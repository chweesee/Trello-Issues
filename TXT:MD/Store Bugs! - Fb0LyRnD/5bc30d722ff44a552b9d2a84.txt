####Steps to reproduce:
- Open the store tab 
- Hover over the games until you find one that doesn't say the rating 
- Check  if they have a rating there

####Expected result:
All of the games show their metacritic rating correctly when hovered over.
####Actual result:
Sometimes they don't show their rating, even if they have one on the website. Is inconsistent, restarting messes with it
####Client settings:
Canary build 26049
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro x64
