### I think I mixed 2 bugs, Subnautica is not supposed to appear in the Nitro store tab (it's not a Nitro game), and when you try to go on some games in the store it crashes (as said in the other notes)

### https://trello.com/c/WkyPR4P3 has been fixed (Canary 36442), now it doesn't crash but Subnautica still appears in the search bar of the Nitro store if you follow the steps
