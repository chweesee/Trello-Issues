####Steps to reproduce:
- Join a server with a STORE CHANNEL and Carousel 
- Make your Discord fill only 1 half of your screen [drag the tab to your left side of your desktop] 
- Click on the Video so it starts playing 
- Than Make your Discord cover the whole Screen again

####Expected result:
The Video that you've been watching should still be in the Middle of the page [Clicking on NEXT doesn't fix the glitch]
####Actual result:
The VIDEO or IMAGE or GIF is going to move to the side. As I said, you cannot fix it by clicking on the next media.
