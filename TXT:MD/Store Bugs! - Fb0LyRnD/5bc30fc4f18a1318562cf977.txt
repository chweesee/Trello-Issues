Reported by kouwei32#6995

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Discord (Quit and reopen of already on; must be completely off before opened!) 
- Go to the Store 
- Observe (Everything to the right of the DMs / Friends thing goes black for about 0.5 seconds, e.g. Mentions, Help, Search)

####Expected result:
At least the top should load in because these functions are built-in. (e.g. Mentions)
####Actual result:
Everything to the right of the DMs / Friends thing goes black for about 0.5 seconds, e.g. Mentions, Help, Search
####Client settings:
Discord Canary Mac (Build 26143)
####System settings:
macOS High Sierra 10.13.6, Intel x64 Architecture
