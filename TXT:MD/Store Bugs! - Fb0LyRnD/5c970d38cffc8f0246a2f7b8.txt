Reported by Zacatero#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a game waiting in your queue (for me, Minion Masters always just sits there for some reason and never goes away, and even if I get rid of that update, it comes back) 
- Right click another game and press REPAIR 
- Watch the game clear the check 
- Observe what happens after

####Expected result:
Either the game thats been sitting there should return to just sitting there, or it should go ahead and update
####Actual result:
It starts bouncing (See Attachment)
####Client settings:
34463
####System settings:
Windows 10 x64
