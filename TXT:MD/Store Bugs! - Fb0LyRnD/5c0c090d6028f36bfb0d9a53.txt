Reported by J1#0088

####Steps to reproduce:
- go to any game in the store 
- scroll down just enough to hide the Buy/Install/Add to library button (few extra pixels won't change anything) 
- observe that there is no alternative button in the top right of your window 
- try doing it the other way around (by scrolling up) and observe that it shows instantly which works as intended

####Expected result:
the alternative button should appear when the other one is fully hidden
####Actual result:
more scrolling is needed for the top right button to appear when the other button is already fully hidden
####Client settings:
Canary 0.0.224 - 29240
####System settings:
Windows 10 home x64 v.1803
