CR - Can Reproduce - Windows 10 Home x64 - Discord Canary 36345 -  i7-8550U CPU @ 1.80GHz - goes up to 30% from average of 2 to 7 percent cpu without hardware acceleration, and 20 percent from average of 2 to 5% cpu with hardware acceleration - seems to happen with more older cpus then newer ones, still is a problem though
