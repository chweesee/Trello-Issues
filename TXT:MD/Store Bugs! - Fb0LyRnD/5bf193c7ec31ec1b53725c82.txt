Reported by Hole#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a game in the store that you have in the library already. (Minion Masters is probably the best one to test with). 
- First, hover your mouse on the "Add to Library". You should see the "Already in library" popping up. Notice where that is popping up. 
- Then, hover your mouse on the "Add to Library", but this time, from bottom-up. Notice where it's popping up again.

####Expected result:
The pop-up should be consistent at the same spot.
####Actual result:
When you hover in any method outside of bottom-up, it will appear on top of the button. However, if you hover it from bottom-up, it will actually appear in the middle of the button.
