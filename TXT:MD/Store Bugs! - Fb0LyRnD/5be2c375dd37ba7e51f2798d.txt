####Steps to reproduce:
- Install a Discord game (i used Minion Masters). 
- Go to Programs and Features in the Control Panel. 
- Find Minion Masters in the list and proceed to uninstall. 
- Go back to the Discord Game Library and verify that it has uninstalled. 
- Refresh the Programs and Features List and see that Minion Masters is still in the list.

####Expected result:
Minion Masters shouldn't appear in the Programs and Features list after uninstalling the game.
####Actual result:
The game still remains in the Programs and Features list and there's no way of removing it.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary, Build Number: 27574
