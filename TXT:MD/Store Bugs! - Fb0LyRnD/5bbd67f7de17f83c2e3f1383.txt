####Steps to reproduce:
- Go into your User Settings -> Appearance and toggle "Show Games Tab" off (if not already) 
- Go into your Discord Nitro settings panel and click on "View All Nitro Games" under the game tiles

####Expected result:
Either a modal should pop-up telling you how to enable the Store tab or one with the option to enable it right from there and then it takes you to the Store tab
####Actual result:
You're taken into the Store tab even though you have it disabled
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.215, Build 25845
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home 64-bit (v1803)
