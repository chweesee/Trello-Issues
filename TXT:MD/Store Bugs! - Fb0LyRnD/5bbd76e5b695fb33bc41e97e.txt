Reported by Rashaun#9295

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a game in your activity feed that has a view in store button but isn't in store (King of the Hat is one) 
- Click on the view in store button 
- Observe what happens

####Expected result:
Either view in store button isn't there because the game isn't in store, or Discord tells you that game isn't in store and takes you to the Directory
####Actual result:
Discord tries to load the page infinitely and throws two 404 errors in your console each time you try to open the page for the game
####Client settings:
Canary Build 25825
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64 1803
