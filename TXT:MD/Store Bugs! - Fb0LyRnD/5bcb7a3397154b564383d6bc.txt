####Steps to reproduce:
- Discord Store Page 

- Click on a game (Only seems to happen on Galactic Civilisations 3 as this is the only one using the YouTube player

- Clicking on any other 'screenshots' will reload the entire pane and causes the YouTube video to autoplay again.

####Expected result:
I'd imagine that the YouTube video shouldn't autoplay when it's not in focus.
####Actual result:
The YouTube video / trailer automatically plays when it's out of focus and you're unable to pause it.
####Client settings:
I've tested this on Stable, PTB (Build 26659) and Canary (Buld 26655).
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro (x64) 10.0.17134 Build 17134
