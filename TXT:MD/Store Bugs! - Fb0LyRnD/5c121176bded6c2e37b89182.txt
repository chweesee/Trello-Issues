####Steps to reproduce:
- Own a game in your Discord library (I used Minion Masters) 
- Go to that game in the store 
- Scroll down so the "Free" and "Add to Library" buttons display on the top bar 
- Observe how there is no gap between them

####Expected result:
There should be the standard Discord-sized gap between the words.
####Actual result:
They are snugged up next to eachother
####Client settings:
Canary 29532
####System settings:
Windows 7 Home Premium x64 v7601
