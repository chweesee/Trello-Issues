####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a game's store page (I used Warface from the Nitro tab) 
- Under details, click on one of the genre tags and observe

####Expected result:
The genre tags should no longer be clickable, as the Browse page no longer exists
####Actual result:
The genre tags are still clickable and cause the Nitro tab to crash when clicked on
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.258 Build 47521
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro x64 (v1903)
