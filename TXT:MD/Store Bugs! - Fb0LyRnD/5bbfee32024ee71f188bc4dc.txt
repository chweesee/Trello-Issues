####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to Game Library in your settings, and find "Install Location". 
- Press Edit, and input any random name in "Install Location Name", then save it. 
- Then, go back to edit, and completely erase the name you inputted, and press save.

####Expected result:
Since there's nothing in the name, it should go back to "Main" by default, or it should say "This field is required".
####Actual result:
When you press save, it just goes back to the same name you had. It doesn't do anything.
####Client settings:
