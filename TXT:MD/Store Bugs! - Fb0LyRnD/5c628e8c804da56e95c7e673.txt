[Archived] Clicking the "View in Store"-button for (most likely) any Discord Store game that has that button will crash the Store. (Tested with FTL: Faster Than Light, Hollow Knight, Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire). (https://trello.com/c/Ds44oGFP)

P3: Will get fixed eventually,

####Steps to reproduce:

- Find a user playing (or play it yourself) a game from the Store with a "View in Store"-button  
- Click the button (or click the link from the button anywhere in Discord)

####Expected result:
Discord is not supposed to hang up and then show an error message that the Store has crashed.
####Actual result:
Discord is hanging up upon clicking and then tells me that the Discord Store has crashed.
