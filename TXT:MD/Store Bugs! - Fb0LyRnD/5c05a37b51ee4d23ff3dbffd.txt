####Steps to reproduce:
- Copy and paste any store link, or go to the store directory 
- Mouse over the embed or any game embed and observe as the speaker icon appears 
- Mouse off the embed and observe as the speaker icon disappears 
- Try this both with "First on Discord" games and normal games

####Expected result:
Circle appears and disappears when the speaker icon does
####Actual result:
Circle icon only appears when the speaker icon does, and disappears after the speaker icon does, overlaying the "First on Discord" banners on those games
