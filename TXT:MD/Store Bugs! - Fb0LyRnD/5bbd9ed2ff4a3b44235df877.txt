Reported by Rashaun#9295

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to the Store page 
- Download and install a random game (Easier to do with Nitro so it doesn't cost any money) 
- While the game is installing, switch to a random server 
- Hover over the download icon that appears on the Home icon 
- Switch to the library tab while the game is installing, and hover over the same spot again

####Expected result:
The tooltip doesn't appear when you're currently viewing the library page
####Actual result:
The tooltip appears even when viewing the library tab
####Client settings:
Canary Build 25872
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64 1803
