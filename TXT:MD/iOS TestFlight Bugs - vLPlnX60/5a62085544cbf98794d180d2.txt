####Steps to reproduce:
- Change your nickname to something long, such as WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW 
- send a message

####Expected result:
The nickname is cut off early and the timestamp is fully shown
####Actual result:
Then nickname pushes the timestamp off the screen, and even wraps the username to a new line if it is long enough
