Reported by SleepaDru#7700

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to User Settings -> Voice 
- Ensure Voice activity is enabled and all of the correct microphone permissions are enabled 
- Try speaking

####Expected result:
The bar lights up green to indicate that Discord can hear you, as happens when you disable voice activity and observe the test window
####Actual result:
It does not do so, and you get louder and louder hoping the Discord elves one day hear your pleas
####Client settings:
Discord TestFlight 2.2.0 (1910)
####System settings:
iPhone 8+ iOS 11.2 (15C114)

### This is not a bug. What's happening here is you're going into the voice settings and expecting the test bar to react, without being in a voice channel. However, if you're not in a voice channel then your microphone isn't on. We're not listening to you 24 hours a day, we're not the NSA.

This is not a bug, so I'm moving to "Won't Fix". - Jared on 2018-01-08T18:34:40.020Z
