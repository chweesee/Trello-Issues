Reported by HeroGamers#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure your Web Browser settings are set to In-App Browser 
- Send a video in a text channel (about a minute or two in length) 
- Watch the video, in fullscreen/maximized 
- Make changes to the status bar (put your phone to power, disconnect from Wi-Fi or wait a minute) 
- Observe the status bar

####Expected result:
There should only be ONE status bar shown.
####Actual result:
The client saves the status bar's current status, as you start the video, and shows it throughout the whole video, and if you click on the video, to view the timeline, you will notice there are two different bars. [Best seen on videos shot on a phone in portrait mode (see attachment)]
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.2.2 (2352)
####System settings:
iPhone 5s, iOS 10.0.1

### I feel like there are multiple issues here. The 2nd screenshot, the one with the charging icon visible during the video, I was able to reproduce and appears to be a legitimate issue. The others I was not able to reproduce in any fashion. - Jared on 2018-02-13T21:11:36.908Z
