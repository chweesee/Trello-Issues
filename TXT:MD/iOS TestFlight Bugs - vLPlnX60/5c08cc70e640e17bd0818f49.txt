####Steps to reproduce:
- Turn notifications for a channel to "All messages" 
- Have someone send a long enough message that it ellipses 
- Verify that the ellipses isn't highlighted 
- Have the same person send the same message again, but this time ping you at the end 
- Observe the ellipses in the in-app notification

####Expected result:
Ellipses don't highlight at all
####Actual result:
Ellipses highlight if there's a mention after the ellipses in the message
####Client settings:
