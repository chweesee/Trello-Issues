Reported by Pascal#0929

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open any text channel 
- Open the user settings by clicking on the cog 
- Click on language and change your language to German (might happen also with other languages that have the same or even longer size for the send button) 
- Close the user settings 
- Observe the send button

####Expected result:
The send button shouldn't be shorten after language change.
####Actual result:
The send button will be shorten to "S..n". The whole word "Senden" should be shown. Issue can only be fixed by restarting the app and it happens for all text channels.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.2.0 (1982)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s, iOS 11.2.1 & iPad Air 2, iOS 11.2.5 Public Beta 2

### Marking this issue as blocked because https://trello.com/c/Cf0xgI4f prevents (and also prevented) testing it. The language doesn't change instantly for the send button, so you cannot test it at the moment. I will check the issue again once the linked ticket is fixed.

The linked issue is not fixed completely but the language of the send button will now change instantly and it doesnâ€™t get cut off.
