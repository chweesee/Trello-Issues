####Steps to reproduce:
- Go on any server 
- Tap on the search bar 
- Under search options, tap "before:" 
- Note that this only on iPads. I've tested it on my iPod and the bug is not there.

####Expected result:
The date picker pops up so you can enter the date
####Actual result:
Nothing, it just says "before:" in the search bar. You must manually type "before:" for it to work.
####Client settings:
2.2.0 (1910)
####System settings:
iPad Air 2, iOS 11.1.2
