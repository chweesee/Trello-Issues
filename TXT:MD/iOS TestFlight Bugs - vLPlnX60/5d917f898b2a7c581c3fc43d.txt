####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to "Settings" -> "Notifications" -> Turn on "Integrate calls with Phone app" 
- Join a voice channel on Discord 
- Receive or start a phone call/other Callkit call while remaining in the VC 
- Open Discord back up, and observe the banners at the top of the screen

####Expected result:
The older call should be dropped for the newer call, since they should be using the same system
####Actual result:
There is 2 calls at once (Important note: You cannot talk on Discord during the calls, but you are still in both)
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.3 (17389)
####System settings:
iPhone 7 Plus - iOS 13.0
