### I can no longer reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). After sharing the Facebook app on Discord, the picture actually looks decent instead of being stretched out. I used iPhone 8 +, running iOS 12 (Developer Beta 2).

Because I am no longer able to reproduce this bug, I am moving it to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-02T17:01:40.168Z
