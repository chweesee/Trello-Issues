### Can reproduce.
Can Reproduce, but for my device I had to use space bars to the end in order for it to work. Typing letters resulted the text to jump to the next line. iPhone 8, iOS 11.3.1, TF 2.3.6 6095

### Verified on iPhone 8 + running iOS 12, Dev Beta 4 with Discord iOS TestFlight 2.3.6 (6095). The typing indicator looks like it got cut off in half, and seems to be more thinner in general.
