####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a testing category and a voice or text channel. 
- Go to the voice/text channel's settings, then go to the category section. 
- Delete the category on another device, then try to tap the category on the iOS Device to move the channel to that category.

####Expected result:
The client should not crash, and the category should be removed from the category list.
####Actual result:
The category stays in the list, and when tapped, the client crashes.
####Client settings:
Discord TestFlight 2.2.3 (2671)
####System settings:
iPhone 6S, iOS 9.1

### I am still able to reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560), when I click on the Text Category after deleting it, my application just crashes. I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2).

Because I am still able to reproduce, I will leave this ticket to be. - Ghoul on 2018-07-03T01:44:27.893Z
