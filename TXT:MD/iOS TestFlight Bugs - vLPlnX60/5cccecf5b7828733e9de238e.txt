Reported by üíênickWtnüíê#3789

####Steps to reproduce:
- have someone (a alt works to) find a invite to a server that you have never sent before 
- switch to a different server, dm or another channel in the same server 
- have the user or alt send the invite and observe what you see in the in-app notification

####Expected result:
you should not see a partial uncached invite or cached invite embed, just like if it was a invite you have sent before
####Actual result:
you see either a partial uncached invite or cached invite embed
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.0.1 (14577)
####System settings:
iPhone XR, ios 12.1
