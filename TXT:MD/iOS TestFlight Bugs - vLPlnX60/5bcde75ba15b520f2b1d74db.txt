####Steps to reproduce:
- Open another app in Split View mode with Discord 
- Open the new Discord emote picker 
- Change the size in Split View mode of the other app with emote picker being still opened (e.g. from 75-25 to 50-50) 
- Observe the emote picker/keyboard

####Expected result:
Keyboard and emote picker should look normal without any overlapping or resizing issues.
####Actual result:
Client resizes (you will see a black bar at the bottom) and predictive text going out of bounds.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.3.9 (8385)
####System settings:
iPad Air 2, iOS 12.1 (PB 4)
