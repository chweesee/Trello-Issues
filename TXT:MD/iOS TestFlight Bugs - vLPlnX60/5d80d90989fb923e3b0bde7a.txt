####Steps to reproduce:
- Navigate to the "Add Friend" search 
- Using a Japanese keyboard, type any Japanese character(s) in the "DiscordTag#0000" input box. 
- Tap off of the "DiscordTag#0000" input box (which should now have 1 or more Japanese characters within it). 
- Watch the letters inside the text box, and then click the text box. The text should shift upwards slightly. 
- Watch the letters inside the text box again, and click outside of the text box. The letters will shift back downwards. 
- You can repeat the last 2 steps multiple times;

####Expected result:
The text should not shift, just like it happens with English text.
####Actual result:
The text shifts when the input box contains even a singular Japanese character and the steps are followed.
