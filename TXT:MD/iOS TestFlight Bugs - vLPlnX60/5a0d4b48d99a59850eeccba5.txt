####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a server invite (using button under server name, not from a channel). 
- Tap the invite link to go to it's settings. 
- Tap the Instant Invite Channel. 
- Select any channel that does not have a check-mark. 
- Tap the Instant Invite Channel again.

####Expected result:
The check-mark should have moved to the new channel that you selected for the invite.
####Actual result:
The channel where the invite was originally for stays checkmarked until you save the changes.
