### Verified - Clayton on 2018-01-19T10:14:28.756Z


### The most consistent repro steps I could find were: 

1. Message a user who has blocked you
2. Swap servers - Clayton on 2018-01-19T23:17:53.590Z


### @clayton301 thats a diff bug. urs is repro for the description of blocked message embed is not showing correctly. but its a good find! thx - Fanghao on 2018-01-20T05:03:26.018Z


### No problem, let me know if you still need me to look for a more consistent repro on this one.  - Clayton on 2018-01-20T05:34:36.293Z


### @clayton301 ya that would be super helpful if u have bandwidth. its much easier for us to fix the issue once we have a steady repro. thx - Fanghao on 2018-01-20T05:50:47.321Z

- Be in an active server
- Have someone DM you an invite to a server where welcome messages are enabled and join
- Go back to the server you were previously in - Alexandru Todea on 2018-01-30T06:59:33.091Z

### Can't reproduce.
Cannot reproduce this. I've never seen this. iPhone 5s, iOS 9.3.5 Discord 2.2.5 (2798). Judging by all the repros so far, might be an iOS 11 bug?

### This bug is 11 exclusive. After attempting steps I found, multiple times on iOS 10, I upgraded to 11 and was able to consistently reproduce this bug

### Cannot reproduce anymore as of TestFlight 3.0.6 (16185) with iPad Pro (11 inch) running iOS 12.4.

It looks like the Bug Bounty is now really fixed since there are also no recent reports about it anymore.
