### Can reproduce.
CR, iPad Mini 2, iOS 11.0.3, TF 2.2.3 (2671). Since it's happening on an iPad Mini it apparently isn't just on iPhone X. Also happens in servers, not just DMs.

### Can reproduce.
Finally CR after countless attempts. I was able to reproduce by doing the opposite, landscape then portrait. iPad Air 1st Generation - iOS 11.2.6, Discord TestFlight 2.2.3 (2671)

### Can reproduce.
CR; took me about a million tries or so. Same as Ghoul, start off landscape, and rotate towards portrait. Another note: I pre-emptively turned off the iPad so that it shut off in the middle of the rotating animation. - iPad Pro 12.9" (1st gen) - iOS 11.2.5 (15D60) - Discord TestFlight 2.2.3 (2671)

### I tried many, many times. No luck in reproducing this, not even once. iPhone X, but the comment make me feel like it's not reliant on the iPhone X. - Jared on 2018-02-24T00:47:59.906Z
