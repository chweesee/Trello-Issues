### I checked this ticket during the Trello Event and I am still able to reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). The Enter the Code text goes down into the number text bars for a split second before returning to the position that it's supposed to be in. 

I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2), but I will leave this ticket where it is as I am still able to reproduce. - Ghoul on 2018-07-02T23:48:15.433Z
