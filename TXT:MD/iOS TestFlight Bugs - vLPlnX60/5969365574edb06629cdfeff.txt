Reported by eltontay11#1384

####Steps to reproduce:

- click on edit messages 
- (Do not press "done") 
- press the navigation button and go to another server 
- send something in the server 
- go back to the person who you DM 
- Realise that the text you sent earlier (you pressed edit but didn't edit) was copied to the Send message bar

####Expected result:
: Edit bar disappears and text is not copied to the send message section

### I can no longer reproduce as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). The message that I had opened edit no longer copies into my message bar for me to send. I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2).

Because I was not able to reproduce this bug, I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-02T19:36:25.774Z
