####Steps to reproduce:
- Click on someoneâ€™s profile that you have around 15 or more mutual friends with (the more, the easier it is to repro) 
- View mutual friends and try to scroll down  
- Observe (this may need to be done a couple of times by exiting the profile and retrying)

####Expected result:
The scroll bar should go all the way down when you scroll all the way down
####Actual result:
The scroll bar stops halfway on the screen when you reach the bottom of the mutual friends list
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.5 (17627)
####System settings:
iPhone XR, iOS 13.1.2
