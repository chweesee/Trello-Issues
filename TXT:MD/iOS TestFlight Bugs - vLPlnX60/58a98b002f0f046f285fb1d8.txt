### I can no longer reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). The magnifying glass no longer stops even when showing the channel list. I used iPad Air 1st Generation running iOS 11.4.

Because I was no longer able to reproduce this bug, I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-02T20:04:36.381Z
