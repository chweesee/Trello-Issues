### I am archiving my own report as an extension of https://trello.com/c/NyCTiRGz since it seems like line breaks were apparently never displayed. 

I thought that now, the client fails to display them for messages sent from other platforms as well, I am not 100% certain if that's always been the case. However, it should be taken into consideration when deciding the priority of the bug mentioned above. - Alexandru Todea on 2018-01-05T08:01:33.758Z
