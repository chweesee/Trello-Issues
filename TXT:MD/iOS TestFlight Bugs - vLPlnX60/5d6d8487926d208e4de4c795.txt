### So I would like to just let eMagic, oh no (Alex) and Jonwu know that , that while yes this happens with the voice call refresh it also happens on the on the original voice call screen. Iâ€™m also pretty positive this is below iOS 12.4 only, which I removed the iOS exclusive part from this report because of the fact someone could reproduce on iOS 13. I would also like to note that if I take a screen recording of this issue it will show the inverse of whatâ€™s on your screen. And because it flashes it also kills the recording. Please let me know you guys have any further questions.
