####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a user you have messages with. 
- Block him/her. 
- Attempt to edit a message youâ€™ve sent.

####Expected result:
Either an error message would appear or nothing would happen.
####Actual result:
The message is highlighted as if you were editing it, but the keyboard doesnâ€™t appear and the only way to get rid of it is to go into a different channel, then go back.
####Client settings:
