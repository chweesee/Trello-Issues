[Archived] (Most likely iPad only) When turning the screen several times in a channel with filled reactions, discord sometimes gets stuck with a huge black area. Usually can be fixed by rotating the screen again but sometimes that causes discord to crash. (https://trello.com/c/OUDjW227)

P3 - Will be fixed eventually

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open discord. 
- Go to a channel with MANY reactions (usually announcements in big servers). 
- Rotate the screen many times. 
- Notice that it may get the black space but fix itself or remain and still be usuable. 
- Notice that it can be fixed if turned again but that it may also cause discord to crash. (or if fixed and continued to rotate it will crash sometimes)

####Expected result:
It shouldn't have smashed up (black space) and it shouldn't crash.
####Actual result:
Rotating the screen several times in a channel jammed with reactions causes it to smash up and leave empty space that may or may not fix itself.. but when turned again to fix, it sometimes crashes.
####Client settings:
Testflight 2.4.2 (10647)
####System settings:
Ipad Air, iOS 12.1.1
