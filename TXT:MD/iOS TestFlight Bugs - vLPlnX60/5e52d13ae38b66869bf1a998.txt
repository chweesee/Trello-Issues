### It seems this is only reproducible only if no one is in the voice channel. It also seems that longer can push down the button even further if you swap to a language that has a long descriptive text that runs onto more lines.

### Happens when transferring boosts too, the "transfer boost" button seems morphed into the bottom of the screen

### Seems to effect screen sizes too. On an iPhone 5S, the button is completely gone
