####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to your iOS settings 
- Open Display & Brightness -> Text Size 
- Change your size to the latest one (7th option) 
- Go back to Discord 
- If you are using a 5.5 inch & bigger device, change the language to one whose translations for the profile headers are longer than the English one (e.g. German or Dutch) 
- Long hold a user and open the User Settings 
- Observe the profile headers (Mutual servers, Mutual friends, ...)

####Expected result:
Profile headers should wrap when being too long (as it already happens when using non-scaled font size).
####Actual result:
They don't wrap und overlap itself or get cut off.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.3.8 (7233)
####System settings:
