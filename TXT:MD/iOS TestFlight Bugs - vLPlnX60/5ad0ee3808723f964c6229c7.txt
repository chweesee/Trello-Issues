Reported by Rashaun#9295

####Steps to reproduce:
- Join a call or VC in Discord on your phone 
- Go to the homescreen on your phone while having Discord open in the background 
- Transfer the call to another device (I used my laptop) 
- Watch for the red bar showing you still connected to Discord to disappear

####Expected result:
The red bar at the top of the screen disappears
####Actual result:
The red bar doesn't disappear and Discord still registers you as in a call even though the app shows you not in the call
####Client settings:
TestFlight, 2.3.0
####System settings:
iOS 11.2.6

### I cannot reproduce on iPhone 8 + running iOS 11.4.1 with Discord Stable App 2.3.3. The red banner disappears as soon I pick up the call on my desktop client, and Discord doesn't seems to let me know that I am still in the call on my phone. - Ghoul on 2018-06-01T17:35:12.308Z
