####Steps to reproduce:
- Ensure your username is less than 7 characters long (excluding discriminator) 
- Go to a server you have manage permissions on 
- Create a category with the name "test1" 
- Edit the category and deny two permissions for the everyone role (e.g. connect and speak) 
- Create a category with the name "test2" 
- Open the audit log 
- Tap Filter, then Filter by Action, then select any action 
- Change the filter back to All Actions 
- Observe the third entry in the log

####Expected result:
All audit log entries should be fully visible
####Actual result:
The third entry (created overrides) stops wrapping so the text goes off screen
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.4.0 (9477)
####System settings:
iPhone X, iOS 12.1

### Not actually a duplicate of the ticket I linked - this is a completely separate bug.
