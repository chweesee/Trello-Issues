### Can reproduce.
TL;DR is that there is an non-tappable area in the search bar, with a bigger area the smaller the device. See attachment for the area on an iPhone 7: iOS 13.4.1; TestFlight 18.0 (19599). Can also reproduce iPad 7: iPadOS 13.4.1; TestFlight 19.0 (19670) which in turn has a much smaller non-tappable area.
