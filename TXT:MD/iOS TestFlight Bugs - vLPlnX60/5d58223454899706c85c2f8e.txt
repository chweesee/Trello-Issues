None

Created: 2019-08-17T15:50:12.598Z
Latest Update: 2019-10-07T16:30:33.237Z

Reported by Jedi3 Cafè Manager#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Get a cdn link that ends with `.mp4` at the end 
- Tap on it and observe that it doesn’t play, it loads infinitely with 0:00 on each side 
- (I have noticed that it does happen on Giphy, Gifer, Imgur, Gfycat though they act differently then a cdn mp4 link, as they just load but without 0:00 on each side and has no constant loading sign in middle)

####Expected result:
It should load right away and not load infinitely
####Actual result:
Loads forever and has 0:00 on each side when in the picture itself if you click on it
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.1 (16898)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s - iOS 12.2
