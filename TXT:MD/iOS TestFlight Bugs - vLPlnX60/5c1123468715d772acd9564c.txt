### The chat window can receive user input after following these steps: 1. Open the sever list.  2. Go to a direct message with another person.  3. Press the three dots in the top right of the screen.  5. Press "Add friends to DM".  6. Press cancel.   The chat window should now receive user input again. iPhone 7, iOS 12.0, TestFlight 2.4.1 (9907)
