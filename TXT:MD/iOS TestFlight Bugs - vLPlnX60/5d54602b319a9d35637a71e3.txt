Add a `!canrepro` to this ticket if you find any places with **performance issues** in this build and describe where and how the issue happens.

Something you can add here are these kind of issues:

- The app being slow
- The app taking a long time to respond to an input
- Unclean scrolling (like when you scroll, it bumps up and down a million of times)
- Lag in an area, like emojis, server members, etc.

Crashes are **not** something that should be added and should always get their own new ticket.

### Can reproduce.
Short Description: The edit role button lags for a second or 2

Steps to Reproduce: 
- Make sure you have edit perms or Administrator on a server. Not Ownership
- Have a user type in that same server 
- Now block that user and wait for the ‘{} Deleted Message(s)’ and press it to bring up the original message
- press the users avatar 
- press ‘Manage’ 
- press ‘Edit Roles’
- Observe the little lag spike 

Expected Result: It should show a nice clean animation into the edit roles page

Actual Result: There is a slight 1 or 2 second delay

System: iPhone XS, iOS 12.3.1
