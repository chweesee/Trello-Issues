####Steps to reproduce:
- Find someone who you do not have any mutual friends. 
- Open their profile. 
- Go to mutual friends.

####Expected result:
No friends in common image stays within its bounds and you can go back to mutual servers and user info.
####Actual result:
Image overlaps keeping you on mutual friends (can't swap to mutual servers or user info) until you close the profile modal and reopen.
####Client settings:
Testflight 2.2.6 (3373)
####System settings:
iPhone 7, iOS 11.2.5

### Appears to be some specifics in regards to this, this does not occur on iPads or any plus-sized phone ( anything > 4.7'), on a 4.7" screen it requires the user having at least one badge.
