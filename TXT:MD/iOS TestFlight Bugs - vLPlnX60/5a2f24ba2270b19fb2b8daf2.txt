### This bug is apparently still occuring to the older devices, according to the today's reproduction tickets in here. I tested it out myself and found that I was not able to reproduce on my iPhone 8 +, iOS 11.2.5 (Public Beta 2). | Another BH was not able to reproduce it on iPhone 7, and so I am suspecting that it is happening to the older devices varying from iPhone 5 to iPhone SE (includes iPhone 6S/6S+), as well some older iPod and iPad devices. Will be passing this to a trello moderator.
