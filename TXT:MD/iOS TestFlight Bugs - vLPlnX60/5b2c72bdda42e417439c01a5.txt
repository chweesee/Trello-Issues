### I checked this bug during the Trello Cleanup Event, and I can still somewhat reproduce as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5660) on iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 3). The message bar does disappear, but the keyboard will remain. So I think this bug is still happening, but partly fixed.

Because of this, I'll leave this ticket to be. You can see the image below. - Ghoul on 2018-07-07T01:28:59.341Z


### **Extension to the issue that still happens:**
- Make sure you have kick or ban members permission
- Open any channel
- Click on the message bar so the keyboard opens
- Long hold a user
- Click on user settings
- Select Kick or Ban
- Open the keyboard again by clicking on the reason field
- Close it and go back to the chat

### **Another extension to this issue (iPad only)**

- Open Discord in Split View mode
- Open the keyboard in the app that is in Split View mode with Discord
- If the message input field doesn't rise up, close and reopen the keyboard
- Swipe left or right in Discord to open member or channel list
- Close the keyboard

### Can reproduce.
With predictive text turned off, the result that I got after following the steps was: the keyboard doesn't hide and the chat bar turns invisible. (Screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/Pz4RfG3.jpg) iPhone 7 Plus, iOS 12.1.3, TestFlight 2.4.3 (10936)
