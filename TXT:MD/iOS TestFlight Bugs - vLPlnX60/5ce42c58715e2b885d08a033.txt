### The issue is only partially fixed as of TestFlight 3.0.2 (15283). Now it happens that the iPad uses the whole screen for only the chat, neither the member list nor the channel list is shown when closing Split View or Slide Over.

Attached a screenshot for it. - Pascal on 2019-05-28T22:20:51.495Z
