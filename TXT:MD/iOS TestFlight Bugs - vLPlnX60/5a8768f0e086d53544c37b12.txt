####Steps to reproduce:
- Send/receive a webhook message 
- Long hold the webhook message 
- Observe the color of the message options

####Expected result:
Only the option to report the message (which doesn't exist for webhook messages) should be red colored.
####Actual result:
The last message option is red colored (for example delete message).
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.2.3 (2671)
####System settings:
