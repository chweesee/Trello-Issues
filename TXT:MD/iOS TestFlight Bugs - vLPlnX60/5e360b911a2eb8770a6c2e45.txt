####Steps to reproduce:

- View an announcement channel you do not have permission to send messages in 
- Scroll up

####Expected result:
The jump to present banner is aligned properly.
####Actual result:
The jump to present banner is improperly aligned. Going into a different channel and scrolling up and going back to the announcement channel seems to leave it in a different place.
####Client settings:

####System settings:
iPhone 7: iOS 13.3.1 & iPad 7: iPadOS 13.3.1
