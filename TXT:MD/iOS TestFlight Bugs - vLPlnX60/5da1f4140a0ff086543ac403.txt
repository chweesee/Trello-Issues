####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a discord server with the perfect amount of channels/categories so that a category is right at the bottom 
- Scroll up and down slightly and look at the category channel name 
- Note: vertical screen height is very important, so my test may not work for you

####Expected result:
The category channel name should be visible, but slightly cut off at the bottom
####Actual result:
The category channel name disappears
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.5 [17627]
####System settings:
iPad 5th Gen [A1822] - iOS 13.1.2 [17A860]
