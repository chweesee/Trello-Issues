### Can reproduce.
iPhone 8 +, iOS 11.2.5, Discord TestFlight 2.2.0 (1910) | It is difficult to see at first but if you watch the scroll bar as you scroll down, thatâ€™s kind of like driving the car in a extremely bumpy road where it keeps going up and down. (If you know what I mean.)

### Can reproduce.
CR, iPhone 6 w/ iOS 11.1.2 on Discord TestFlight 2.2.0 (1910). Scrolling around the menu seems to teleport the user to multiple different categories when scrolling at moderate speed and stopping on random places.
