Reported by enamored#1222

####Steps to reproduce:
- join a public vc where someone is streaming and view the stream  
- leave the stream (could take more than one attempt for the message to appear) 
- observe

####Expected result:
there should be a prompt asking us to “tell us about your (stream) experience” and there should be an “x” in the corner to close the message window.
####Actual result:
there is an empty space where the prompt should be and no “x” to close the message.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.2.1 (19209)
####System settings:
iPhone 11, iOS 13.3.1
