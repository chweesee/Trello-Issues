### I cannot reproduce this bug as of iPhone XS Max running iOS 12.3 Dev Beta 1 on iOS TestFlight 3.0.1 (14476).

I've tried this bug multiple times, but I did not have any success. So I'm going to move this ticket to Cannot Reproduce, but I will take a look if you feel like there is a better reproduction steps that would help me to test and repro. - Ghoul on 2019-04-30T06:42:05.032Z

### The bug in this is that when you select and delete a custom emote from the emoji picker, switching to the ABC keyboard will act like the name of the emote is still typed in the message bar
