None

Reported by Rashaun#9295

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a server where you can view the audit log and either manage channels or roles 
- Add a role to a user, or edit channel overrides, anything that will show a subaction in the audit log 
- Go into the audit log and expand that entry 
- Observe the beginning of the action line, and the beginning of the action information line (what action was done, and the specific info for the action)

####Expected result:
Both lines start at the same spot like on desktop
####Actual result:
The second line is slightly indented more to the right than the first line
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.4.0 (8667)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s iOS 12.1 Dev Beta 5
