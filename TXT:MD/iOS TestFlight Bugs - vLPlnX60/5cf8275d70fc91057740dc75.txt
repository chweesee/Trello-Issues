####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to any channel where you have permissions to post a link. 
- Make sure that the link is large enough so that it takes a couple of seconds to upload. 
- Upload the image, and while the image is uploading, swipe up so that the upload is out of view, and back down quickly. Repeat this step multiple times. 
- Observe.

####Expected result:
The upload should occur normally.
####Actual result:
The loading bar goes back down every time you swipe up and down.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.0.2 (15283)
