### I can no longer reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). I am able to scroll up and down the chat just fine despite of having the mentions and channel mentions drawer up. I used iPhone 8 +, running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2)

Because I was not able to reproduce this bug anymore, I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-02T19:47:32.960Z
