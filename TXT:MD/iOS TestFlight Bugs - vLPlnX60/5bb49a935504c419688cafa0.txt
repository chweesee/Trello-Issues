Reported by Zimm#5220

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a server that you have admin rights on 
- Click on the 3 dots next to the server name 
- Dont click on any of the options 
- Click the home button to come out of the app 
- Go to your notifications and click on one of them so discord opens that server while the menu is still up 
- You can now access some basic info of any server, such as the member list, where it is hosted and the channel and category creation screen (Doesnt work though)

####Expected result:
You should be in the menu, where you can buttons such as Server Settings, Create category, Create channel, ect on any server you like
####Actual result:
You should be able to access that basic information on any server you like
####Client settings:
Testflight 2.3.9 (7858)
####System settings:
iPhone 7, iOS 12
