### Can reproduce.
CR, iPhone 8 +, iOS 11.3 (PB2), Discord TestFlight 2.2.3 (2617). Please take a look at my screenshot. The first yay that’s by itself is formatted correctly while the yay in multiple lines are not formatted correctly which would mean it’s not really an extension of a bug that was fixed.

### You don't need strikethrough for multiple lines. Just a new line with any text after the strikethrough will cause this bug.

### **Extension to this issue**
If you use any emoji (doesn't work with custom ones) before or after the strikethrough, it won't be centered.

### **Another extension**
If you try to delete or pin a message with strikethrough (no matter where it is placed or how long the message is), the strikethrough for the confirmation modal with the message looks like underline.
