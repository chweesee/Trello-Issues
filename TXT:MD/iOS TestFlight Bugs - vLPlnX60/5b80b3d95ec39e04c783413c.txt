### this ticket and along with the similar malfunction when Wifi off are both from recent changes. I suspect background and multiple setups are culprits here. - Fanghao on 2018-08-25T07:37:09.170Z

### This only happens when Microphone permissions are denied, then you get it all the time. If microphone permissions are enabled, you don't get it.

So maybe the high pitched, annoying audio is still there?

### No I can repro this with microphone enabled. I also add a fix to complete remove microphone usage for nearby feature. Haven public TestFlight it yet. - Fanghao on 2018-08-25T20:34:34.860Z
