### This bug happens on light theme, but you have to do a few extra repo steps after "- Click again on this image and open the image in the browser by clicking on the 3 dots". You must then, -Click done after the images opens - Observe the status bar, once you are back... you should depending on your battery (charging or low) either see it or not, as the only thing on the status bar..
