### I Cannot reproduce as of iOS TestFlight 2.5.2 (14408) on iPhone XS Max running iOS 12.3 Dev Beta 1. I was not able to crash with the mentioned role name, as my client is running fine. 

I’m going to move this to Cannot Reproduce. - Ghoul on 2019-04-24T01:14:53.189Z

### @_pascal_ showed me the demonstration. Apparently you really needed to create the role then name it as specified on Desktop because iOS refuses to accept the name in the STR as a role name. 

With that new additional. I am now able to reproduce as of iPhone XS Max running iOS 12.3 Dev Beta 1 on iOS TestFlight 2.5.2 (14008). It shows the Nelly screen for me. 

So verifying this as P3 high considering of how unique the characters are and it only works with roles which is less than likely to be abused in a way or form. Moving to Backlogs. - Ghoul on 2019-04-24T20:39:10.471Z
