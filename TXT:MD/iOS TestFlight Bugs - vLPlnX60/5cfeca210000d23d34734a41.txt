- Scroll up so the red “new messages” line and the “load more messages” box are visible.  
- Scroll up more.

####Expected result:
More messages should load.
####Actual result:
More messages do not always load. I have been unable to find 100% reproducible conditions for this.

### does it never load or will load eventually just slow? - Fanghao on 2019-06-11T19:47:06.179Z

### @fanghao2 It seems the bug only happens when you are at the top of the oldest visible new message and then it will never load when just scrolling to the top and not doing any of the workarounds mentioned below, at least that is how it happened for me. So if you open a channel and are at the bottom, the bug won’t happen.

Of course there are several workaround to load more messages:

- Scrolling a bit down and then scroll again to the top
- Click on the new message since banner
- Click on load more messages button

I could make a screen recording if that would help. - Pascal on 2019-06-11T20:19:15.304Z
