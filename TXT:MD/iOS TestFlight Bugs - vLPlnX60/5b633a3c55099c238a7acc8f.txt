### This also happens with several other places. For example member and ban search. Might by a design choice and so intended behavior.

### Verified on iPhone 8 + running iOS 12, Dev Beta 4 on iOS TestFlight 2.3.6 (6095). The keyboard stays up for at least 10 seconds after I exited the Account section in my User Settings. I've also changed the title slightly to better summarize the issue.

I am moving this ticket to Verified Bugs. - Ghoul on 2018-08-02T23:09:17.596Z
