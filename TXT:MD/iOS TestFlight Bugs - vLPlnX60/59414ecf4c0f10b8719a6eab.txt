####Steps to reproduce:
- Type (or have someone else type) a code block that has text before it, after it, and an empty line inside of it. A simple one is a\`\`\`

\`\`\`a. 
- View it on iOS discord.

####Expected result:
The stuff in the code block should be formatted as a code block
####Actual result:
No formatting is applied and you see a bunch of backticks followed by your code block's text followed by some more backticks.
####Client settings:
iOS App Store, 1.8.7
####System settings:
iPhone 7, iOS 10.3.3 (14G5037b)

### I can still reproduce. 

Discord 2.2.1 (2236), iOS 11.2.5, iPhone 8 Plus - Alexandru Todea on 2018-01-28T11:37:13.991Z


### **Extension to this issue**
This also happens with single line code blocks by using only one backtick.

### **Another extension**
The issue seems to be a general Markdown bug because it also happens with bold, italics, etc. Maybe that changes the priority?

### Can reproduce.
iPhone 8+ iOS 11.4 (discord ver 2.5.1) I can reproduce this easily, and can also work around it by adding a blank line before and after the code block. This album shows the issue and workaround: https://imgur.com/gallery/ZJNYt0F
