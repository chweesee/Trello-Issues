- Make sure mark as read is still there by not having a server muted 
- Go to notifications

- Tap on the server name again 
- Observe

####Expected result:
you should still be able to mark the server as read even though you muted the server fully

### This also happens on servers you own if you have a channel muted. Un muting the channel however also doesnâ€™t give you the mark as read option until you restart discord.
