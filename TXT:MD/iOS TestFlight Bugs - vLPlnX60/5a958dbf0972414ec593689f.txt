### I checked this bug during the Trello Cleanup event. As of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560), I am still able to reproduce but that appears to be on YouTube as the embeds does not show up properly until I switch channels and back. I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2).

Unfortunately, at this time. The ticket will not be moved.  - Ghoul on 2018-07-02T17:21:19.751Z
