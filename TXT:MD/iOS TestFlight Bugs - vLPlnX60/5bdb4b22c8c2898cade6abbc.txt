### Can reproduce.
iPhone 5s iOS 12.0.1, TestFlight 2.4.0 (8841) - - I can reproduce, however I think this is a result of iOS' default keyboard characteristics. Unless specifically integrated with the function, such as autofill, it closes the keyboard when you tap outside of the keyboard's area.

### Can reproduce.
iPad5, IOS 12.1 (Most recent Testflight) - - I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bug it is how iOS behaves when tapping outside the keyboard it does it anywhere
