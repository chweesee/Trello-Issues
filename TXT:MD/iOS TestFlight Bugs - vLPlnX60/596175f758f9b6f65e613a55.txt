####Steps to reproduce:
- Connect to discord voice server without bluetooth earphones 
- Talk to some awesome cool people 
- Try to connect bluetooth earphones 
- Confirm that those awesome people just can't hear you without you 
- Restart the app and it works again

####Expected result:
Connecting the bluetooth earphones whilst on a voice server should still allow you to talk as per normal
####Actual result:
You can hear everyone else on the chat, but they can't hear you unless you restart the app
####Client settings:
1.8.8
####System settings:
iOS 10.3.2 iPhone 6S

### Can reproduce.
 iPhone 7, iOS 11 beta 2, 1.8.8. Tried with AirPods, connecting them whilst in a voice channel resulted in the other users in it not being able to hear me. It worked, however, fine again by just just leaving and rejoining the voice channel.

### I can no longer reproduce, the user on the other end could hear me when I connected my wireless earphones.
