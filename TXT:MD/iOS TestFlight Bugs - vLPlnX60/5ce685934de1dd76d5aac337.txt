####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to any server with a server banner. 
- Go to channels list and scroll to the top to fully reveal the server banner. 
- Scroll down so the server banner is no longer visible. 
- Switch to other applications but do not end Discord in the multitasking screen. 
- Use phone as normal until Discord is unloaded. 
- Head to home screen. 
- Go to Discord via the home screen. (not verified if this is the only way to trigger the bug.) 
- Observe.

####Expected result:
Server banner does not appear.
####Actual result:
Server banner appears and is partially obstructed by category bars, if any.
####Client settings:
