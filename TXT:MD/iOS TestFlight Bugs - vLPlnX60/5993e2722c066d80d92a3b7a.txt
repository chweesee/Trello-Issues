### The same issue happens with the kick permission, you don't have access to server settings.

### I checked this ticket during the Trello cleanup event, and I can no longer reproduce as of iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 3) and Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5660). 

I can now see the Server Settings option, but I cannot see it with the kick perms which is related to this ticket: https://trello.com/c/dUJ1fP6p which appears to be cross platform. So I will be moving it to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-07T01:58:48.389Z
