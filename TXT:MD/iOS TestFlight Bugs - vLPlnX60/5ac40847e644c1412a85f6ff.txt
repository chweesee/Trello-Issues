### Can reproduce.
SOMEWHAT CR; iPad Pro 12.9" 1st Gen, iOS 11.2.6, Discord Build 2.2.6 (3415). See attached video, black box only stays for a second. It also does a lot of wonky stuff occasionally. Please ping me if it is determined that this should not be approved.

### Can reproduce.
Can reproduce. It's entirely possible this just may be the way that it works and will be a Won't Fix, but we will see. Using admin powers to approve as this report has been in the queue for a very long time
