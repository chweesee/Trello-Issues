####Steps to reproduce:
- Start a call on iOS with call kit on.  
- Open your desktop client and join the call.

####Expected result:
The CallKit based call should “hang up”.
####Actual result:
The CallKit UI never dismisses itself even after the original call has ended on desktop. (The callkit UI continues to show that there is an active call.)
####Client settings:
TestFlight (18423)
####System settings:
iOS 13.3
