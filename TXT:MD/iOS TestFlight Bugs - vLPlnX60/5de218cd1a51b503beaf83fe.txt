### An extension of this is that it outputs the text into the chatbox in the channel, however the new chatbox experiment is not required, the steps for this are as follow: - Go to any text channel - Send an invite to a read-only channel (Important: It must be a server that youâ€™ve already joined) - Type some text in the chat box - While the keyboard is on-screen, tap the invite embed (not the invite link) - When you enter the server, you should see the send button is now white instead of gray - Go to another channel or server then come back to the read-only channel - Observe the result. Client Settings: TestFlight 3.1.9 (18591). System Settings: iPhone 6 Plus, iOS 12.4.4
