[Archived] Images and embeds sent through Discord generate a VoiceOver element between the user's username and the image/embed that sometimes prevents you from scrolling past it [Only applies to images/embeds with the username directly above, behavior does not occur if messages with text are sent and then the image is sent soon enough that the username/time info doesn't appear above it) (https://trello.com/c/c5KJZjiP)

P3 - Will be fixed eventually

Reported by binchlord#0998

####Steps to reproduce:
- Enable iOS VoiceOver 
- Find a channel with images/embeds 
- Swipe to scroll back and forth past the image/embed 
- Do this a few times

####Expected result:
VoiceOver should go straight from the username of the user who posted something to the image/embed
####Actual result:
VoiceOver detects an element with no content between the username and image/embed. Sometimes while scrolling past this, element, VoiceOver will get stuck in a loop going between the empty element and the username
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.5 (17627)
####System settings:
iPhone XR & iPad Air iOS & iPadOS 13.1.3
