Reported by Rashaun#9295

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a message that has over 100 users for reactions (Ghoul's post with 1000+ users from DDevs would be a good example.)
- Hold the message, and click on Reactions.
- Try to scroll down to see all of the users. 

####Expected result:
You can scroll through +100 users, like you would with the member list.
####Actual result:
You can only scroll down to 100 users. (Can be shown in the video attached to the Trello card)
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.3.1 (4025)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s iOS 11.2.6

### Can reproduce.
I tested on Discord Developers on my message where I had 907 reactions as of April 27th, 2018. I was only able to see 100 reactions out of 907. I will attach the video of the reactions in a moment. â€”

### This hasn't been completely fixed, currently, it seems like the app is only able to load up to 100 users in the reaction list. Moving back to Verified Bugs.

### With Dabbit's permission, I have edited the title and body for the remaining use case as eMagic confirmed that it was a bug that you could only see 100 users. 

I can reproduce this bug as per Curse's comment. I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 11.4 with Discord Stable Version 2.3.3. I am moving this bug back to Verified Bugs.  - Ghoul on 2018-06-04T22:05:36.232Z
