####Steps to reproduce:

You should be able to scroll down, and easily press the ban button.
####Actual result:
You aren't able to scroll down, making the ban button super hard to press because it's cutoff by the screen.

### iPhone with bigger screens, such as iPhone 6 and above will not have a problem since their screen size is larger.

### Can't reproduce.
As Binara#5278 said this will only effect smaller iPhones, but not the iPhone 6 and above. iPhone 6S Plus, iOS 11.0.7 (Beta 7) > TestFlight 1.9.1
