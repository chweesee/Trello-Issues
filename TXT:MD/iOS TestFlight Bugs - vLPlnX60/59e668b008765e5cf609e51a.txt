### Can reproduce.
CR, this can also work if a message got deleted and if the text channel has a lot of messages that are super long (like bug-bot's reports for example). Also works on desktop. iPhone SE, iOS 11.0.3, Discord TF build 1.9.2 (953) and MacBook Air (11-inch, Early 2015), MacOS Sierra 10.12.6, Discord Canary 0.0.156

### Can reproduce.
CR. iPad Mini 4 (iOS 11.0.3) and iPhone 5C (iOS 10.3.3). Works better with really flooded servers with something even quicker than 1 mps (message per second). Attachment shows my friend spamming a phrase on my server and me trying to reach the bottom.

### Can reproduce.
CR, this happens more on big servers with multiple conversations going on, as you said a speed of ~1mps. Iphone 6, iOS 11.0.0, TF 1.9.2(953)

### Cannot reproduce. I am seeing buggy behavior where I can't scroll at all, but it is not jumping back to the New Message Line. - Jared on 2017-10-26T20:25:47.175Z
