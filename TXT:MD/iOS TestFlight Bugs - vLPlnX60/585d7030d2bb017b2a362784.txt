####Steps to reproduce: 
- On Desktop, place a mention in the channel topic of the main general channel. Use the format of <@###########> and place the mention at the bottom of the channel topic on its own line. 
- There must be one blank line above the meetnion as well. The mention can not be on the line immediately following the text. 
- Try opening the users panel in that channel on iOS, or navigating to that server right after opening the Discord app. 

####Expected result:
  User sidebar opens correctly/can access the server normally. 
####Actual result:
  App crashes out.

### If the snowflake mention is escaped with a backslash, the app does not crash and displays the mention properly rather than just as plain-text.
