### Can reproduce.
Can reproduce, iPad Mini 2 on iOS 11.2.6 and iPhone 6 on iOS 12.1.1, TF 3.0.1 (14776). Occurs only with emotes past the twelfth in the section (counting from the first emote in the section), and also occurs with global emotes. Also occurs with the final emote in the "Recently Used" section. May have to force close app first.
