####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a group DM 
- Start or join a video call 
- Rotate to landscape (anticlockwise) 
- Tap the ellipses (3 dots) and then tap Members

####Expected result:
The screen should be padded to avoid the notch, or should automatically switch to portrait like the voice settings screen
####Actual result:
The group member screen appears in landscape and is partially obstructed by the notch
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.2.0 (2042)
####System settings:
iPhone X, iOS 11.2.1

### Submitted by Ghoul#4567:

Extension to this bug report:
This bug does not appears to happen unless you follow mouse91 and Pascal's reproduction steps (no matter if it's landscrape or portrait), so here are the reproduction step:

 - Follow the original bug report's steps.
 - Hang up the video call.
 - Go over to your friends list
 - Scroll up and down
 - Observe as you're scrolling. 
I was expecting to see the friend list to scroll smoothly, but it seems to be lagging in performance as well having a blank slot for a moment before it shows up as a friend. You can see this video here: https://youtu.be/a6UJy1sZ8WU It may be difficult to see at first, but it may take a few re-watches. - Tarek on 2018-01-05T04:16:06.903Z


### Just noting to say that my extension-bug and the original bug can be reproduced on TF 2.2.0 (2073). I used iPhone 8 +, iOS 11.2.5 (PB3).
