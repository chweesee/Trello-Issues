### Cannot reproduce.  I never see the 1+ banner, and the normal ones disappear as you'd expect.  Here are my steps:

1)  Close app.
2)  Open App.
3)  Wait for it to fully connect
4)  Open Server Select (hamburger button)
5)  Select a Server showing the unread message indicator.
6)  Tap on the channel the unread message is in.
7)  The <number> banner appears.
8)  Scroll to bottom of the chat.

Result:  The banner disappears. - Jared on 2016-12-09T19:05:37.572Z


### I missed  the "default text channel" bit.  The banner does go away when scrolling up/down. - Jared on 2016-12-09T19:17:35.152Z

### At least for me, any attempts to scroll to the bottom of the channel will cause the app to jump back to the new messages banner.

### Verified this issue still occurs as written as of 1.8.0 (56) - Jared on 2016-12-19T23:50:18.180Z


### Since default channel has been removed, it only happens with your last opened channel.

### I can no longer reproduce, the banner goes away as soon as I view all new messages in my last opened channel.
