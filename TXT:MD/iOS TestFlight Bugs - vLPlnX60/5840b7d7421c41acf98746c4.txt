Reported by dinos#0649

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Start typing a message with : 
- Type anything that comes to mind so long as it's not a valid emote and it doesn't contain spaces 
- End the message with : 

####Expected result:
 You see the raw :text: message 
####Actual result:
 The client tries to render a non existent emote and thus creates an invisible/blank message
