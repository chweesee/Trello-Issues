####Steps to reproduce:

- Open any iOS app (e.g. the Photos app) that has the ability to share something with other apps 
- Select something (e.g. a photo) 
- Click on the share button and choose Discord 
- Tap on `Share in` and search for a server that has no own icon but the default one 
- Also select Direct Messages, tap on `Share to` and search for users with default avatars

####Expected result:
The correct server icon und user avatar should be shown for the share extension
####Actual result:
You will always see the same avatar/icon (the Discord logo) for the users and user with now own avatar/icon.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.3.0 (3740)
