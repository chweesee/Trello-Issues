### Can reproduce.
iPhone 8 Plus - iOS 12 & iPad Air 2 - iOS 12.1 Public Beta 1, TestFlight 2.3.9 (7731) - Only happens when opening a link on any website that will be opened directly in the app. Typing manually any invite link in your URL address bar doesn't work, the landing page will be opened then. Also make sure your app hasn't crashed before or fully reloads, it won't crash then but nothing happens.

Direct example: Just click on this invite link in your browser or Trello app: https://discord.gg/discord-testers
