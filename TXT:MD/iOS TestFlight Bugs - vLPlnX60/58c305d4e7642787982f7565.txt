### Can't reproduce this any more before the invite is expired and the text was never added here. - Jared on 2017-10-24T23:45:14.857Z


### Moved from Verified Bugs to Cannot Reproduce by Jared on 2017-10-24T23:45:18.811Z


### Can reproduce.
iPhone 6s with iOS 11.0.3 & iPad Air 2 with iOS 11.1 PB 5, TestFlight 1.9.3 (1336). See Mikesky's note below. It is an issue when there are 3 spaces after an word and then a linebreak and a new word. Also I can't open such a server anymore after bug occurred because it crashes every time. The only fix is to change the description via Desktop.

Example:
```Test   
test```
