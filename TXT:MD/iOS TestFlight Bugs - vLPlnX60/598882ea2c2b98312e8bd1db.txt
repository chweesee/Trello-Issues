Reported by Pascal#0929

####Steps to reproduce:
- Use a bot with Discord rich embed 
- add boldness text with \*\* inside the bot's embed message 
- send the message in a chat and view it with an iOS device

####Expected result:
Text should be shown bold and not with \*\*
####Actual result:
Text won't be shown with boldness and just `**` before and after the text. This issue probably also applies for other Markdown formatting.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 1.8.9 (83)
####System settings:
iPhone 6S, iOS 10.3.3

### After some investigation and testing I have come to the conclusion that this ticket is an extension of https://trello.com/c/r83EsHrP

The problem mentioned there happens with every Markdown formatting and applies for embeds too.

Moving back to New Issues and archiving. - Pascal on 2019-04-12T13:25:08.972Z
