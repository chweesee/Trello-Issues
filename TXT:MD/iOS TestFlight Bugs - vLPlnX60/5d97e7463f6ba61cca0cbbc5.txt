####Steps to reproduce:
- Type out a mention of a user who's username will trigger spellcheck when selected 
- Select it 
- Swipe your finger across the keyboard to trigger iOS QuickPath 
- Click one of the mention suggestions

####Expected result:
Using QuickPath to change the text should remove the previous text, using a mention suggestion should not bring back text that was removed using QuickPath
####Actual result:
Text from the original mention that was modified with QuickPath will be reinserted if a mention suggestion is used
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.4 (17575)
####System settings:
iPhone XR iOS 13.1.2
