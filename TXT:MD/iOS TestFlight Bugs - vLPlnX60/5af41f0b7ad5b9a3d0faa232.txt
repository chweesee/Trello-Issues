####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a fresh server with your main (iPhone)

- Let your alt join (iPad)

- Transfer ownership to your alt (should work as it prompts u to fill in a code) (iPhone)

- Transfer ownership back to your main (your alt is required not to have 2FA) (iPad)

####Expected result:
Transferring ownership should disappear
####Actual result:
Transferring ownership button stays and you are allowed to click on it multiple times even though it does nothing until you click “close”
####Client settings:
Stable 2.3.1
####System settings:
iPad 2nd generation, iOS 9.3.5

CR - Can Reproduce - iPhone 6s - iOS 13.1.2 - Testflight 3.1.5 (17627) - I had 2fa enabled on my main when I reproduced the bug, and transferred ownership to my alt, same thing happened as not having 2fa  (the button was still clickable) - also not iPad Specific anymore I assume
