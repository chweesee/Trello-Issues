####Steps to reproduce:
- Enable iCloud photo library when not enabled 
- Go to any text channel 
- Click on the paperclip icon 
- Observe the recent images

####Expected result:
All recent images should be shown regardless they are in the iCloud or not.
####Actual result:
You can only see recent images that are stored locally (taking a screenshot right now will show it in recent images).
####Client settings:
TestFlight 1.9.3 (1286)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s with iOS 11.0.3 & iPad Air 2 with iOS 11.1 PB 5
