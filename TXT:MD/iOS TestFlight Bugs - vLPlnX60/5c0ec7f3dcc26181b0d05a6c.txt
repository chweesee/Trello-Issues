####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a server owner give you only the Manage Roles permission 
- Go to a channel you can edit the permission overrides for, and tap the channel name to open the overview 
- Verify that you see the channel permissions section in the overview 
- Close out of the channel overview and open the channel list 
- Long press the channel and observe the options that pop up

####Expected result:
You see the "Edit Channel" option because you can edit channel permissions
####Actual result:
You don't see the "Edit Channel" option despite being able to manage channel permissions
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.4.0 (9714)
####System settings:
