Reported by luma#2845

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Discord above an app in Slide-Over mode 
- Press the message box.

####Expected result:
Message box should slide up above the keyboard to remain visible while the keyboard is shown (similar to split view)
####Actual result:
Message box is stuck under the keyboard, messages are not visible and the keyboard must be hidden before you can send.
####Client settings:
iOS Stable 2.1.1
####System settings:
iOS 11.2 on 10.5" iPad Pro
