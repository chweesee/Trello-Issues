Reported by Arnold0#7514

####Steps to reproduce:
- Search something (I used in:ios-bug-reports as a search) 
- Click on one of the results 
- Notice how the loading screen animation stops before it gets fully to the left of the screen

####Expected result:
The loading screen should go fully to the left and be full screen
####Actual result:
The animation stops before being fully to the left and it only becomes full screen once loading is finished
####Client settings:
2.4.6 (11856)
####System settings:
iPhone SE, iOS 12.1.2
