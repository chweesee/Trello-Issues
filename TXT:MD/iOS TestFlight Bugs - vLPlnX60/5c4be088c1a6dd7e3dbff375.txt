Reported by Pascal#0929

####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure you are using your iPad in Landscape Mode 
- Open any server with Manage Emojis permission 
- Go to your server settings 
- Open Emojis 
- Upload a new emoji 
- Observe the yellow tick in the top left corner

####Expected result:
The yellow tick shouldnâ€™t overlap with the clock in the status bar or the status bar should get removed completely when editing the image (same behavior as the Photos app for example).
####Actual result:
It will overlap with it. Also the editing tools for the image look a bit incorrectly spaced.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.4.2 (10773)
####System settings:
iPad Pro 11â€œ, iOS 12.1.3 (PB 4)

### Can reproduce.
Could reproduce with only an iPad Pro 11". I was unable to reproduce this using an iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 3 â€” bug might be exclusive to iPad Pro. All of the devices were running IOS 12.1.1, and the Discord build was Testflight 2.4.2 (10773).

### As of TestFlight 3.0.5 (15973) the issue with voice channels and image previews **is fixed**, only the original issue still happens.

Therefore decreased the priority to P3 low again. - Pascal on 2019-06-30T11:28:10.197Z
