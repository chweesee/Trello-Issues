####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a channel where you can upload images 
- Have someone send a message (this provides the best occurence) 
- Open your camera roll and select an image 
- Close the keyboard and upload the image 
- Observe the animation of the image uploading, and the message from the other user

####Expected result:
Image uploads without a strange animation
####Actual result:
Image uploads from the middle of the image, causing messages to sometimes briefly overlap with each other
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.4.5 (11416)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s iOS 12.2 Dev Beta 2
