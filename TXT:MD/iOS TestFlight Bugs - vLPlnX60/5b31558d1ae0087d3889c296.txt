### I can no longer reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5548). The description now says that it will notify the users with that particular role in a specific channel. I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2).

Because I was not able to reproduce this bug, I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-06-30T03:04:49.546Z
