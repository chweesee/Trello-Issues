### This bug is happening on the non 4” devices at least on iPhone and iPod. So I have alternated the title slightly. 

I am able to reproduce on iPhone 8 + (5.5”) running iOS 12 Developer Beta 1 with Discord Stable 2.3.3. 

However, the result was slightly different from the previous posted screenshot. It is now being cut off and covering the Close dialog. I will be attaching a screenshot. - Ghoul on 2018-06-17T14:29:33.262Z
