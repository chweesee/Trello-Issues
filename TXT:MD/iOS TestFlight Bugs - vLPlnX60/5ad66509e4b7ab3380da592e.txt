####Steps to reproduce:
- Go in the Server Settings (a large server would be preferable) 
- Go in the "Members" section 
- Tap the 3 dots on the top-right of the screen 
- Tap "Prune" 
- Change fast the options, so, tap on the first and on the second, the third and again, fast

####Expected result:
It should choose the right option, without any latency
####Actual result:
Sometimes it takes an other option, and then it goes on your previous Option
