####Steps to reproduce: 
- Get an extended bar, easiest way to make this happen is to enable personal hotspot and connect a device, or go on a call. 
- Open the app, once the extended menubar is visible. 
- Navigate the app, especially swiping motions, keyboard up/down and user selection. 

####Expected result:
 The app behaves as normal. 
####Actual result:
 The app glitches, shows whitespace underneath text when navigating, and various other UI features misbehave. 
####System settings:
 iPhone 6s Plus on iOS 10.2.1, App Store app version 1.8.1 .
