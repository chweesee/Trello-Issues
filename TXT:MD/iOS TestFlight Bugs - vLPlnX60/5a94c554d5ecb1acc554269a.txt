### When performing the bug, going to a tiny channel topic instead keeps the space extended with a big space on the bottom.

### It should be fixed when last time I moved to claimed fixed column. - Fanghao on 2018-05-16T00:08:54.536Z


### I can no longer reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). After extending the channel description then closing the member list and reopening, the channel description is no longer extended and moves back up normally. I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2).

Because I was no longer able to reproduce this bug, I am moving it to Claimed Fixed.  - Ghoul on 2018-07-02T17:09:32.860Z
