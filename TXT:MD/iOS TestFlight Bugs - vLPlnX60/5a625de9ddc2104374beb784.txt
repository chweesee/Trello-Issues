####Steps to reproduce:
- Create an rich embed with a bot or webhook 
- Add an author name and a thumbnail to this embed (note: don't add an image, otherwise thumbnail wouldn't be visible) 
- Make the author name very long (length depends on the display size) 
- Observe it with the iOS device

####Expected result:
Author name and thumbnail shouldn't overlap each other.
####Actual result:
A part of the author name will be overlapped by the thumbnail.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.2.1 (2202)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s, iOS 11.2.2 | iPad Air 2, iOS 11.2.5 PB 6

### Not easy to reproduce this issue. Best way to see the bug is to use an very, very long author name that can't be displayed in one line and must be wrapped **without** spaces.
