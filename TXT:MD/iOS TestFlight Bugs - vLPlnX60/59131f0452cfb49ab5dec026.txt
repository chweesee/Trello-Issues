### Although this bug is basically irrelevant (the report function doesn't work on iOS anymore), the "actual result" is valid to all parts of the app where you don't have permission (Server Integrations, Roles, Channels etc). This bug should "ideally" be closed and a new bug reported on the "actual result" section.
