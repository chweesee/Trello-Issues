### Can reproduce.
iPhone 6s - iOS 12.2 - TestFlight 3.1.2 (17140) - I find doing stuff before like tapping the camera or messing with the volume part and waiting a few seconds after opening the debug panel allows you to crash more consistently

### Can reproduce.
CR iPhone 8 iOS 13 (Public Beta), TestFlight 3.1.2 (17140) - It crashed once, when I turned on the video call button, then proceeded to open the debug list. Did not crash any other time though.
