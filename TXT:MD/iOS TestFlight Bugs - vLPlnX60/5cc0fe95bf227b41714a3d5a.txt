### I can reproduce on iPhone XS Max running iOS 12.3 Dev Beta 1 on iOS TestFlight 2.5.2 (14408), When I click on the in-app notification, it only closes the channel / server list and I have to click it again if I want to go to my DMs.

I am verifying this as P3 Mid, while it's a minor bug - it does feels like an annoying bug that would bother people. But since you are still able to access the DMs in the notification by clicking twice, I wouldn't see this as having too much impact on usage other than annoyance.
