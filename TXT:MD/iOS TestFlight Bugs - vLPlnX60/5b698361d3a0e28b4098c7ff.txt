####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Privacy&Safety 
- make sure one of the "Use data to..." is in the background 
- Tick it and watch how a warning  will open and the animation will move it back without clicking "No, take me back!"

####Expected result:
It should be as if you turned off as you did try to turn it off
####Actual result:
It moves as if you turned off, open a warning, and the option moved back as if you turned it on again
####Client settings:
Testflight 2.3.6 (6427)
####System settings:
iPhone 6, iOS 10.2.1
