### Moved from New Issues to Backlog by Clayton on 2018-08-23T21:40:16.127Z


### The ticket is partially blocked because the open in browser option got removed and it is unclear whether this was intended.

The copy image issue mentioned below still happens.

Update: The feature was removed intentionally, so only the copy image issue is still valid. - Pascal on 2019-08-23T14:09:44.360Z
