####Steps to reproduce: 
- Join an active server (we reproed this in discord linux and API) 
- Scroll halfway inside a role, so that some names are cut off 
- Wait for a user to come online, or someone to go offline 

####Expected result:
 Nothing happens 
####Actual result:
 beautifully abstracted and smashed names and roles :^3 
####System settings:
 iPhone SE (iOS 10.2) Discord 1.8.2 (65)
