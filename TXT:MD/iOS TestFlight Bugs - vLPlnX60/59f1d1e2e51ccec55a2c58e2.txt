### I have encountered an extended part of the bug. On TestFlight 1.10.0 (1574), if you tried to create a new role no matter how long or short the name is. The list does not show up until you scroll down, which makes it an extended part of the bug. 

The device used was iPhone 8 + running iOS 11.1.1
