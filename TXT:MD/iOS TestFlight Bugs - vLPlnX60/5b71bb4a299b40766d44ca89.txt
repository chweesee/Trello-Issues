Reported by Rubenvds#5257

####Steps to reproduce:
- Upload a large file in a DM (or a smaller file on poor wifi) 
- switch to a server and slide in to a channel 
- you see the uploading file bar won’t disappear (sometimes after a while it does disappear)

####Expected result:
the upload file bar will disappear when switching to a channel (or just be in every chat, because in dm’s the bar is invisble)
####Actual result:
the upload file bar is always visible
####Client settings:
-i
####System settings:
Iphone SE IOS 12 Beta 5
