####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to an huge server such as DTesters, DFeedback, DDevs, etc. 
- Make sure you are in a general channel. 
- Scroll down the member list slowly at first to observe, then scroll down as fast that you possibly can.

####Expected result:
Member list should go up as its being scrolled down, and nothing is being smashed.
####Actual result:
When you scroll down too fast, you will notice that some members will smash up against the role, aka Online - number
####Client settings:
Discord TestFlight 2.2.1 (2236)

### Cannot repro this on iPad, this is likely an iPhone only bug and should be noted in the title.

### I can reproduce on 2.2.0 (2080) but someone suggested it may be a iPhone only bug, and it might be NAB. But I will leave this up to the developers. Pascal can reproduce a little differently on his iPad and will be attaching things.

### Can reproduce.
Scrolled up and down in the user list for 20-30 secs really fast and got a huge space between two users. Also, going back to the messages is almost impossible, lag is insane. User list doesnâ€™t lag you just have to exit and then come back to message again. iPhone 6, iOS 11.1, TestFlight 2.2.1 (2236)
