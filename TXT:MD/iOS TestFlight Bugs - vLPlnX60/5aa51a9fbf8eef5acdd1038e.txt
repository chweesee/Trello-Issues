####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a text channel. 
- Type a mention in the form username#0000 (or select a user from the suggestion pop-up). 
- Type a long string of text after the mention. You can paste in a long URL or type a bunch of random letters. 
- Hold backspace. After a brief moment, iOS will begin deleting words instead of characters. 
- Observe how the suggestion pop-up appears when the mention gets deleted. 
- (Optional) Selecting a suggestion from the pop-up causes the app to crash.

####Expected result:
The suggestion pop-up should not appear when the mention gets deleted.
####Actual result:
The suggestion pop-up appears, and selecting something from the pop-up crashes the app.
####Client settings:
2.2.4
####System settings:
iPhone 7, iOS 11.2.6

### I can no longer reproduce as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560), the suggestion pop-up never appears as I'm deleting my text by holding the backspace. Because of this, I am not able to crash my app. I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2).

Due to being unable to reproduce this bug, I am moving it to Claimed Fixed.  - Ghoul on 2018-07-02T21:01:22.636Z
