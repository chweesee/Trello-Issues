####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure you are in a lot of servers (50+), and note the positioning. 
- Move any server (DTesters will be optimal in this situation) all the way to the top, and stay there. 
- Close all app processes, and reopen Discord. 
- Open Discord, and while the app is loading in, move the position of the server you selected in step 2 BEFORE Discord finishes loading in. Make sure that the verified server icon does not appear, otherwise that shows that the app has loaded in. If so, start again from step 3. 
- Note how your server placement has reset.

####Expected result:
Your server icons should stay the way they are
####Actual result:
Your server icon placement resets.
