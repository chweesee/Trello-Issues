[Archived] [Voiceover] The server boost page in the server profile is set up in such a way that the auditory feedback is confusing and jumps from the rewards of one level to the rewards of the next with no indication of which level the perks are being read from with VO enabled (https://trello.com/c/93Zw8kPH)

P3 - Will be fixed eventually

Reported by binchlord#0998

####Steps to reproduce:
- Enable iOS voiceover 
- Open a server profile 
- Open the boost page 
- Select a boost perk and start swiping right/navigating around the page

####Expected result:
You should go from the level name down the list of perks so that the perks are listed after the level and are listed in order
####Actual result:
You go from level header to level header (with no way to open the no boost page) and then bounce back and forth between the rewards for different boost levels
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.9 (18507)
####System settings:
iPhone XR iOS 13.3

### Note: Had to open nitro page first then enable VO because it can not open the server info popup when clicking on the server title.
