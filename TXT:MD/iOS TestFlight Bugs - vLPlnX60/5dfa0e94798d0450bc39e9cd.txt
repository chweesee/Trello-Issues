####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a link that has embedded/send a link in a channel you have embed perms in 
- Click the link in chat (you will be brought directly to the site with no popup) 
- Click the embedded version of the link (you will get the links are spoopy popup)

####Expected result:
The same link should not be treated differently in/out of an embed and clicking the link to a site you just visited without confirming should not ask you for confirmation
####Actual result:
Links are only spoopy in embeds (they are also always spoopy in bot embeds), even if you've just visited the site through a non-embedded link
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.9 (18591)
####System settings:
iPhone XR iOS 13.3
