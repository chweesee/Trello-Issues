Reported by ❤nickWtn❤#3789

####Steps to reproduce:
- Find someone you would like to mention, do a mention, do a new line, and then tag a channel 
- Type the message and send it. 
- Obverse the sent messages

####Expected result:
The mentions should slightly overlap as a thin line (like in 1.9.2), and not be easily noticeable.
####Actual result:
The overlap is very noticeable and you can see without zooming in on it.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.2.2 (2352)
####System settings:
iPod touch 6 generation, iOS 10.3.3
