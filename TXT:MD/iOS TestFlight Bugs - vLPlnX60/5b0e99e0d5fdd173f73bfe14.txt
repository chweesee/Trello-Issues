Reported by ArtyGD#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have Friends List open 
- Force close Discord
- Put your phone on Airplane Mode (Poor connection will help, but airplane mode is strongly suggested).
- Open it.
- While it is loading (having Wumpus on friends list section), quickly swipe right to see the search bar.
- As soon that you see the search bar, quickly click on it before Discord loads completely. May take a few tries on a fast connection, but can be more easily reproduced on a slow connection (15ms ping)

####Expected result:
Searching tab should open
####Actual result:
Discord crashes
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.3.2 (4760)
####System settings:
iPhone 8, iOS 11.3

### I was able to reproduce this ticket, however, the old reproduction steps didn't really tell that you were required to have the Friends List to be open prior to the force close. So I went ahead and put in the missing steps and edited this ticket.

Because I was able to reproduce this bug on iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2) with Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5425), I am moving this ticket back to User Reported Bugs for verification.  - Ghoul on 2018-06-29T19:12:37.264Z

### Let's try this one more time as per Pascal#0929 who suggested that Airplane Mode should be added in the part of the reproduction steps while testing if bad connection doesn't help. 

I am able to reproduce this bug by having a bad connection and Airplane mode. My application will crash upon tapping on search while Discord is attempting to load. I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2) with Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5589).

I am moving this to User Reported Bugs, and hopefully this time will help. - Ghoul on 2018-07-03T02:50:24.097Z
