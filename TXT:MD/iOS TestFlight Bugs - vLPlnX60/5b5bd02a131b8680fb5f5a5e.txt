### Can reproduce.
Can Reproduce: iPhone 8+, iOS 12 Dev Beta 4, Testflight 2.3.6 (6095) â€” It takes me to my welcome channel with no messages at first, but on second click, the messages of the main channel load. But however, voice invites dont take you to the voice channel on both tests.

You need a link with the following format https://discordapp.com/channels/{guildid}/{voicechannelid} (Canary and PTB link don't work). The expected result might be to open the welcome (first channel) in your server because that is what the Desktop app does

### Verified on iPhone 8 + running iOS 12, Dev Beta 4 with iOS TestFlight 2.3.6 (6095). After following the link with (https://discordapp.com/channels/<serverID>/<channelID>), it leads me to a empty text channel.
