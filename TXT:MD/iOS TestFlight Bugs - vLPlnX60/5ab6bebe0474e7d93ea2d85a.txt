### Can reproduce.

### Can reproduce.
iPhone 6s Plus, iOS 11.2.6. TestFlight 2.2.6 (3440); Works for all if the first messages that appear from that channel. EG, if 7 messages from #general were to appear first, in a row, only those 7 would have the bug work.

### Maybe expected result is different: When this message menu is intended, it should be shown for all search results and pinned messages/recent mentions. 

Also some options like editing the message are a bit buggy.

### I can no longer reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560), when I hold down onto the first result - it just really does nothing for me. I used iPhone 8 +, running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2).

Because I was not able to reproduce this bug, I will move it to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-03T01:48:00.024Z
