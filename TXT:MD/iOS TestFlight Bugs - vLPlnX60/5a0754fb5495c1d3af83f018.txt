####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to your "Direct Messages" 
- Click on the search for users and groups there 
- Type something 
- Observe the icon to remove search input

####Expected result:
The "x" icon to remove search input should be in white color like the other "x" icons.
####Actual result:
It is black and also the search background is black, so you can barely see it.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 1.10.0 (1551)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s, iOS 11.1.1

### I can still reproduce, the icon is black and not white.

### This still happens with server settings (member and ban search) and permission overrides (roles and members). 

The search for dms and groups no longer has the issue because it got replaced with the Quick Switcher.
