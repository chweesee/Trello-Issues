Reported by TellowKrinkle#5281

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have someone post an emoji prefixed by a backslash in a sentence 
- View it from the iOS app 
- This might cause it right here, \üç© this text will probably not be shown on an iOS device.

####Expected result:
The emoji is shown as a part of the sentence
####Actual result:
The emoji and all the text after it until a new formatting mark will not be rendered
####Client settings:
Discord iOS 2.1.0
####System settings:
iPhone 7, iOS 10.3.3 (14G60)
