####Steps to reproduce: 
- go to a server where you can create a text channel 
- click the + button on the main server page (NOT server settings) to make a text channel 
- try and make a text channel with a space in the name 'test channel' 

####Expected result:
 you get an error because there is a space in the name (like it does if you try and make one via server settings) 
####Actual result:
 nothing happens when you click 'create' 
####System settings:
 iphone 6, latest discord, latest iOS
