Add a `!canrepro` to this ticket if you find any places with **performance issues** in this build and describe where and how the issue happens.

Something you can add here are these kind of issues:

- The app being slow
- The app taking a long time to respond to an input
- Unclean scrolling (like when you scroll, it bumps up and down a million of times)
- Lag in an area, like emojis, server members, etc.

Crashes are **not** something that should be added and should always get their own new ticket.

### Can reproduce.
Insane lag when viewing a member at the bottom of the member list in a very large server (10000+) | Steps to Reproduce: - Be in a very large server (DTesters works for this bug) - Open members list - Scroll to the very bottom - Click on a profile at the very bottom - Observe Expected Result: The profile should open as normal Actual Result: Insane lag starts to occur, preventing you from using discord as normal. Tabbing out of discord and going back in with multitasking completely freezes up the app. Client Settings: TestFlight 3.1.7 (18209) System Settings: iPhone XR, iOS 13.2
