Reported by Can Göksoy#8645

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open the user profile of any user 
- Click in the right corner on the "more" button 
- Select "Add as Friend"

####Expected result:
You should get a success message that the friend request was sent (similar to the other sent friend request button below the user avatar)
####Actual result:
There is no indication and the user doesn’t know whether sending friend request actually worked.
####Client settings:
Discord 2.4.4. iOS
####System settings:
iPhone 5S & iOS 12.1.2

### Not a bug; due to privacy reasons you aren’t supposed to know whether someone accepted your friend request or not.

### That actually looks like a bug/bad UX because the user gets no indication whether the button actually worked or not. Updated the ticket to make it a bit more clear. - Pascal on 2019-06-15T12:48:38.249Z
