### Moved from User Reported Bugs to Fix made, not yet released by Fanghao on 2018-06-27T18:47:44.334Z


### I can no longer reproduce this ticket as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5548). The message now stays when I need to go to the server while typing in the DM instead of disappearing like a ghost. I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2).

Because I am no longer able to reproduce this bug, I will be moving this to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-06-30T02:59:59.628Z
