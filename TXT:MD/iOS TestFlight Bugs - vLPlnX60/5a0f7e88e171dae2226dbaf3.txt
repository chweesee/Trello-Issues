####Steps to reproduce:
- Collapse a category with at least one channel (e.g. channel `#test`) 
- Get a new message or mention in `#test` 
- Make sure you have other channel in the same server opened and not `#test` 
- Observe the channel list

####Expected result:
Channel should instantly appear.
####Actual result:
Channel is hidden and doesn't appear instantly. You need to change the view to see it or reload the app.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.0.1 (1610)
####System settings:

### I can still reproduce, you need to mark all channels in a category as read and then get a mention in one of them while the category is uncollapsed. Reopening.
