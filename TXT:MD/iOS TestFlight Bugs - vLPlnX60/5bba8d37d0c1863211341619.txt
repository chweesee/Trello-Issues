### I am moving this ticket to Won't Fix because the NSFW toggle was removed from the iOS application to comply with the Apple's Terms of Service.

However, as for the mentioned extension - slowmode value and the fact that you have to watch it closely. I'm going to declare this as Too Minor, regardless of whether the NSFW toggle was removed or not. - Ghoul on 2019-04-02T04:55:32.145Z
