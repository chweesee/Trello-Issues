### Moved from New Issues to Webhook Profile by Jonathan Wu on 2019-10-23T19:43:02.041Z


### Can reproduce.
Can repro - Notes: If I "view server" on a news post that is from a server I am in I see that server and view it correctly. Was able to repro under the condition that I was not in the server the news channel was from. - iPhone 7, iOS 13.1.3, Testflight 3.1.6 (17811)
