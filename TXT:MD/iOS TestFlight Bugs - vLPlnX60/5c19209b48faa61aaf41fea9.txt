####Steps to reproduce:Action 1: Open up Spotify Action 2: Play song from playlist Action 3: Play song from playlist that is locally stored Action 4: Wait for discord IOS to break instantly

####Expected result:
Discord should show that I am listening to a song, without completely breaking
####Actual result:
Discord freezes the messages around where the broken embed was sent into any discord server you go in
####Client settings:
Discord IOS, 2.3.8
####System settings:
Ios 12.1.1
