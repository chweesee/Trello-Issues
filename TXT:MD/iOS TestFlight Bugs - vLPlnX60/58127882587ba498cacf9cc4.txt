### They are only italicized for me. - Jared on 2016-10-27T22:23:23.519Z


### Moved from User Reported Bugs to Verified Bugs by Jared on 2016-10-27T22:23:27.699Z


### Verified this issue still occurs as of iOS TestFlight 1.8.0 (56) - Jared on 2016-12-19T22:22:07.935Z


### Also happens when trying to both underline and bold text.

### Unarchiving because the other one is the dupe. - Jared on 2017-10-25T19:59:49.229Z


### It is not only problem with bold and italics but all markdown formatting. You can only use one formatting at the same time, the other ones are just not shown.
