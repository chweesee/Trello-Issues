- Open search and tap the "in" parameter 
- Type some text that will suggest channels, and then type some text so you have no suggested channels

- Delete more text until you delete everything except the "in" parameter 
- Observe the suggested channels each time you delete a letter

####Expected result:
Suggested channels change depending on what you have typed

Search parameters will flash each time the suggested channels change

### Extension to this issue
Short description: Pasting a long text in the search bar (such as a bug report) and deleting it with backspace button makes the search unresponsive and to start flickering the filters
Steps to reproduce: 

- Copy a very long bug report such as 11635 with the whole Markdown formatting (link for it here https://pastebin.com/LGVMup5V)
- Open the server search and paste the text there 
- Start deleting the search input with the backspace button (hold the backspace button, do not stop deleting) 
- After everything has been deleted, try to search or to close the search

Expected result: Search should still work and not cause any visual issues.
Actual result: Search is very unresponsive and no longer works for some time. Also the search filters start flickering.
Client settings: TestFlight 2.4.5 (1113)
