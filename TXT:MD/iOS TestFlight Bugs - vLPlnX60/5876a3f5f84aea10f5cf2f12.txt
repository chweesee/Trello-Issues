### Was able to reproduce this bug in every attempt. SupDos#7622 assisted me in this. (Notes: this occurred when discord was in the background and when it was fully closed while the phone was locked, SupDos will provide video of what happened each time it crashed) (Testing was done on an iPhone 5s on iOS 8.4)

### Still occurs in TestFlight version 1.82 and possibly worsened by also crashing the person calling (both me and SupDos crashed 1/3 times and SupDos crashed all 3 times)
