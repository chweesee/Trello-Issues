####Steps to reproduce:
- Write a very long message (at least 8 lines) 
- Select a word at the last line of your message 
- Now move the cursor and select even more lines before (make it slowly to see the result e.g. try to select lines 8 to 5) 
- Observe the result when selecting multiple lines

####Expected result:
It should only select the lines you are trying to select.
####Actual result:
When scrolling back (at the beginning of the message text field where the message is cut off and you have to scroll to see the other part) it will automatically select more lines than wanted (e.g. it will select lines 8 - 2 instead of 8 - 5).
