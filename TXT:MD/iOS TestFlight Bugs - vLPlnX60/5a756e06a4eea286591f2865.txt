### I can no longer reproduce on Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). The Spotify invite now shows the option to join via the Desktop app, instead of it being over. I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12, Dev Beta 2.

Because I am unable to reproduce anymore, I am moving it to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-03T01:00:12.899Z
