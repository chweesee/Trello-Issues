####Steps to reproduce:

- go to any server (like Discord Testers) > on mobile 


- click on the server name so it opens the notifications settings etc. 


- click on notification settings (now u should see mute {server name etc. on mobile) turn mobile push notifications on 


- switch to desktop 


- open the notification server settings (on desktop) 


- Mute (for example: Discord Testers) and notice mobile push notifications turns off 


- go back to your mobile (you should have notification settings still open) 


- mute discord testers server on desktop and notices mobile push notifications button doesnt switch off
