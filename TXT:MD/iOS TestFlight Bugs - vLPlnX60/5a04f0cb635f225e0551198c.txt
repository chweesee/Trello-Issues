### I can no longer reproduce as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5589), the title has changed completely to "All Users" when searching for the user due to the QuickSwitcher. It goes away when scrolling as normal. 

I used iPad 2017 Model (5th Generation) with iOS 11.2.6 for this bug. Because I am no longer able to reproduce this bug, I am moving this bug to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-03T02:58:50.582Z
