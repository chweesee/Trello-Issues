### Can reproduce.
steps listed not required, can be reproduced by entering anything into the search bar via typing or autocomplete & then tapping anywhere to the right of the text in the search field. Once the cursor has jumped to the beginning of the field, it is impossible to move it, attempting to click elsewhere does nothing and attempting to drag it just snaps it back to the beginning of the field on the left (see video) seems to occur more frequently with poor connection  iPhone XR iOS 13.1.3 TestFlight 3.1.6 (17811) https://youtu.be/GS7Yth241ZE
