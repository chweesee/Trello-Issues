####Steps to reproduce:
- Go into a channel where multiple users have sent messages 
- Open the mention drawer, and type some letters that will shrink the drawer but not close it 
- Delete the letters you typed and observe the mention drawer 
- Repeatedly do this multiple times in a row and observe the user avatars and status indicators as you do so

####Expected result:
User avatars and status indicators stay the same size
####Actual result:
User avatars and status indicators shrink more with each time you change the size of the drawer
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.3.8 (7308)
####System settings:
