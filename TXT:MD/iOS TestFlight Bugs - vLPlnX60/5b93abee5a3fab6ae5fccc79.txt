####Steps to reproduce:
- Ensure you are viewing a server with many channels (Such as DTesters) 
- Close Discord completely  
- Open the TestFlight app 
- Open Discord from the TestFlight app 
- Open the server list 
- Attempt to change to another server using the server list

####Expected result:
You can change to the other server
####Actual result:
Discord freezes momentarily, and then the icon of the server you tried to switch to is darkened despite you not being in it, and you stay in your original server and all channels and categories are hidden
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.3.8 (7106)
####System settings:
iPhone X, iOS 12 Developer Beta 12

iPhone 6s, TestFlight 2.3.8 (7106) | I think I found an extension to this. When you join a server with a ton of spam bots and you get a bunch of DM’s right after joining the server, the server icon becomes blank and you can’t interact with it until you restart the app.

### An extension of this is that sometimes when switching channels, everything will lock up, and you are unable to interact with any buttons
