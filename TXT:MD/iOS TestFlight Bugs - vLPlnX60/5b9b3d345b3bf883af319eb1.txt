####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure your iPad is in landscape mode 
- Go to any text channel (e.g. #test) 
- Start writing a text 
- While writing the text switch to a different (it is important that this happens while still typing text) channel by clicking on any channel in the channel list (e.g. #test-2) 
- Switch back to the first channel (#test) 
- Open the second channel again (#test-2)

####Expected result:
The text should only be shown in the first channel and not in both.
####Actual result:
The same text (or more text) appears in both channels.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.3.7 (6968)
