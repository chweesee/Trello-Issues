####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to your Friends List 
- Click on Create Group DMs. 
- Scroll all of the way down to the bottom.

####Expected result:
There should be some spacing between the final person in the friends list and the bottom bar. It is not supposed to overlap any options.
####Actual result:
It overlaps slightly on the last member, which can be difficult to select.
####Client settings:
iOS TestFlight 2.3.9 (8085)
####System settings:
iPhone XS Max, running iOS 12.

### Moved from New Issues to iPhone X Safe Area by Fanghao on 2018-10-09T21:51:25.343Z


### We are using now a new master ticket here https://trello.com/c/xebJZtcZ for all home indicator issues with iPad Pro and iPhone X/XS/XR/XS Max.

All issues will be transferred to the checklist there. Since this ticket is no longer needed then, I'm moving it back to New Issues and archiving. - Pascal on 2019-04-05T12:08:48.428Z
