Reported by Lieutenant Ben#1674

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a channel then click to change the topic. 
- Type something that you know your device will want to correct, (e.g. something spelt similar to hey but not an actual word) 
- Make sure the little blue correction box is still onscreen, then click save & observe.

####Expected result:
Your device would correct the message and you would exit the channel topic menu without crashing.
####Actual result:
Discord crashes.
####Client settings:
Discord TestFlight 2.3.0
####System settings:
iPhone 7, 11.0
