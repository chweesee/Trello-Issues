####Steps to reproduce:

- Find an available VC 
- Join it and leave [time shouldnt matter] 
- Open YouTube in multitasking mode 
- Play a video, preferably one with bass 
- Notice how the audio sounds flat 
- Click home 
- Open YT in full screen and play the video again 
- Observe how the sound is better and is more full 
- Open discord in multitasking mode 
- Notice how the sound pauses and starts sounding worse again 
- NOTE: The iOS screen recording software doesnt actually capture this bug

The audio just shouldnt
