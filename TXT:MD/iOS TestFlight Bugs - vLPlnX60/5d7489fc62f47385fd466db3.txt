####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to Discord (Preferably if you have TestFlight (17140)) 
- Start a Direct Message call with someone or an alt (which is easier) 
- Have the person (or the alt) you are talking to mute and/or deafen and then mute and/or deafen yourself (if doing it on an alt) so that you or the other person can see if the icon shows 
- Observe (it may take a few tries to attempt)

####Expected result:
You should see the mute and/or the deafen icon from the other person (or alt).
####Actual result:
You don't know nor see if the person (or alt) is muted, deafened, and/or both.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.2 (17140)
####System settings:
iPhone 8, iOS 12.4
