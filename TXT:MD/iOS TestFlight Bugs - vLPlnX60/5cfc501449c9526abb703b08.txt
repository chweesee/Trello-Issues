### Can reproduce.
CR (Can Reproduce). The first time I tried this bug, it was like in the attached image, second try: message was showing fully. After restarting Discord, the first message was showing fully but there was no timestamp and the second message was still showing fine, it's very inconsistent. iPhone 8 iOS 12.3, Discord 3.0.3 Build 15638
