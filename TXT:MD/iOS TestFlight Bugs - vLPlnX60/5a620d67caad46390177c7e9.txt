####Steps to reproduce:
- Send/receive any embed with the Apple emojis ❤️❄️ (heart and snowflake, it might work with other emojis) 
- Observe how the emojis are displayed

####Expected result:
The emojis should be displayed normally.
####Actual result:
You just see a "#" with a "?" instead of the emojis
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.2.1 (2202)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s, iOS 11.2.2 | iPad Air 2, iOS 11.2.5 PB 6
