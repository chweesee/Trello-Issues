### A most wonderful yet pleasant extension of this immaculate issue is that if you (hang on buddy, this is in-app browser specific!) include a # after an / and at the end of the url or if there is another / in the url, have the # before that next one, clicking on it will crash. An example link of this is https://google.co.uk/#iOSbtw#
