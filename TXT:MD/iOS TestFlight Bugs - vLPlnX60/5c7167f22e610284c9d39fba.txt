####Steps to reproduce:
- Add two emotes in the text area  
- move the text bar to the left with 3D Touch  
- Discord will suggest you an emote after that move again to the left with 3D Touch on the other emote  
- it will suggest you an emote again, so move to the right still with 3D touch just before the " : " and after the space between the emotes 
- then type " < " and two "-" to do a long bar 
- when you done like 3 or 4 bars do one more time "-" to do a little bar  
- When little bar is here delete it and type " > "  
- When you will type > the app will crash -

####Expected result:
The discord app crash
####Actual result:
The app crash but not always
