Reported by DatBoi#4219

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a new server in the iOS client 
- You will see that there are certain regions (Amsterdam, Frankfurt) that shouldn't be there/don't appear in server creation on the desktop client 
- Once you've set that server up, if you try and change the region from the iOS client, you will not be able to select regions such as Amsterdam or Frankfurt

####Expected result:
Presumably, you shouldn't be able to select these regions as they are (old) VIP regions
####Actual result:
You can choose a region for your server that should probably not be choosable
####Client settings:
iOS client, 2.3.7
####System settings:
iOS 12 GM, Discord 2.3.7 release
