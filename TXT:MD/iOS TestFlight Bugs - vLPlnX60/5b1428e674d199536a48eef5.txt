### Can reproduce.
Discord TestFlight 2.3.2, Build 4760, iOS 11.2.6, iPhone 5s | I feel like this issue is related to animated emojis, perhaps ones that are over 250k that were uploaded after the limit having been added, as I've always crashed after a certain point between three servers that I know have a lot of animated emojis pre-limit.

### Can't reproduce.

### This isn't a Discord bug. This is the OS killing the application because it's loading too much into memory. Moving to Not A Bug. - Jared on 2018-06-05T16:40:23.825Z
