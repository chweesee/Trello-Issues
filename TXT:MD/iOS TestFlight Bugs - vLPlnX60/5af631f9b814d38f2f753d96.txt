### I can no longer reproduce as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). The category and the lowest section of emojis are now viewable (with the emojis) instead of hiding away. I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2).

Because I was not able to reproduce, I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-02T18:11:29.244Z
