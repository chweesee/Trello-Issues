Reported by CyberiumShadow#1507

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a Note in the Notes app that is below character limit using the `-` list formatting option. (Must be a relatively long note. Best to be done by having the entire note to be one big list)  
- Open the iOS Share Sheet 
- Post to a server/channel

####Expected result:
Message should be rejected as it is greater than 2000 characters
####Actual result:
Message is successfully posted to the server/channel (Unable to edit it until you reduce the message below 2000 characters)
####Client settings:
Testflight 3.0.8
####System settings:
iPhone XS Max, iOS 13 Public Beta 3

### Can reproduce.
iPhone XR & iPad Air iOS 12.4 TestFlight 3.0.10 (16576) - difficult to reproduce because a lot of online character counters undercount the number of character in iOS note formatting
