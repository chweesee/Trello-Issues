### Can reproduce.
iPhone 8 Plus, iOS 12 Golden Master, TestFlight 2.3.8 (7167) - The issue appears to be pretty random, sadly the cause couldn't be found so far. It might be related to inactivity (closing the app, putting your device to sleep). Most of the people could reproduce it with an iPhone 8 Plus, so you have a higher chance to get it with such an device.
