####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to an app in the App Store (It doesn't matter which one)  
- Tap on the blue button with the three white dots 
- Tap on "Share App..." 
- Tap on "Copy Link" 
- Try to paste the link in Discord (It doesn't matter if it is a DM or a channel)

####Expected result:
The app's name and an App Store link should be pasted
####Actual result:
Unlike in every other iOS app only the app's name gets pasted
####Client settings:
2.2.4
####System settings:
iPhone 7 Plus, iOS 11.3 Public Beta (This bug appears also on older versions of iOS 11. It's not an issue of the beta)

### I can no longer reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). I can see the application's name and link. I used iPad Air 1st Generation running iOS 11.4.

Because I am no longer able to reproduce this bug, I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-02T19:43:33.649Z
