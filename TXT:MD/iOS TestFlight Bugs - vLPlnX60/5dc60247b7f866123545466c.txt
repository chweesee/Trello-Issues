####Steps to reproduce:
- Make a server folder. 
- Now on iOS close the server folder. 
- Hold the server folder to the point when you can drag it around on iOS. 
- Keep holding the server folder on iOS and remove all the servers from the folder until the folder is gone on Desktop. 
- When it's gone, observe how the icon doesn't have a fade out on mobile and how scrolling and swiping has issues now.

####Expected result:
It should just dissapear without creating issues on iOS.
####Actual result:
Scrolling through the server list doesn't work anymore and swiping to the right and left is also not working on iOS and the server folder doesn't have a fade out on deletion too.
####Client settings:
iOS TestFlight 3.1.6 (18021)
####System settings:
iPhone SE iOS 13.1.3
