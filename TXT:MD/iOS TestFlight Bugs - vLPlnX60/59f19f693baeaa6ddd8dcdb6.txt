Reported by Pascal#0929

####Steps to reproduce:

- Change your language to German (also a problem with other languages as noted below) 
- Edit a text channel, category or voice channel ("Channel/Kategorie bearbeiten" in German) 
- Go to permissions ("Berechtigungen") 
- Click on any member or role and open the permission overrides 
- Observe the title for this menu

####Expected result:
The title for permission overrides should be "Back" & "Permission Overrides" (in German "Zur√ºck Berechtigungs-Ausnahmen").
####Actual result:
It uses "Channel permission" instead of "Back" as the string.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 1.9.3 (1286)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s with iOS 11.0.3 & iPad Air 2 with iOS 11.1 PB 5
