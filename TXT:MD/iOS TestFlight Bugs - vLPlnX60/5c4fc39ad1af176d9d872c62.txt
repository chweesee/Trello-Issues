####Steps to reproduce:
- ping ghoul for the link to the gif

you are put in a crash loop as soon as it embeds and can only get out of it if you delete it (like if you delete from desktop)
####Client settings:

####System settings:
iPhone XR, ios 12.1

### CNR anymore as of Discord TestFlight 2.4.4 (10993) but I can still reproduce on 2.4.2 (Stable version). But on TestFlight, I can now safely view the channel with the gif without going into a crash loop. Thanks for the help! :heart:  - Ghoul on 2019-01-30T01:02:01.869Z
