### Can reproduce.
You actually need to send the quoted message to reproduce this. It won't work if the quote produces a new date stamp with a line going across the screen, it needs to be done within a day of the last message/before your new day. iPhone 7: iOS 13.3.1; TestFlight 3.1.10 (18928) & iPad 7: iPadOS 13.3.1; TestFlight 3.1.10 (18928)

### An extension to this issue - quoting will also leaving one extra space in the chat box. See https://i.imgur.com/Wb8qDA2.jpg - there is an extra space inserted when quoting after a mention in a server (total of 2 spaces instead of just 1) and in a direct message there is a trailing space (total of 1 space instead of 0)
