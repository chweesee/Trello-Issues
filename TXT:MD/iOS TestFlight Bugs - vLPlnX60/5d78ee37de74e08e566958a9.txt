### Can reproduce.
iPhone 8, iOS 12.4.1, TestFlight 3.1.2 (17237) - In DM calls, I went on desktop to change the region but it does go off speaker. (Difficult on mobile.) In a server VC, if you aren’t the owner, you would need Manage Server (permission) turned on (for a role) in Server Settings to change the region but it goes off speaker also.
