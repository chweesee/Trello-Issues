### I am no longer able to reproduce this bug as of DIscord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5589). The box is scaling to the application size correctly, and everything looks visible to me. I used iPad 2017 (5th Generation) running iOS 11.2.6 for this.

Because I am unable to reproduce this bug, I am moving this to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-03T02:32:33.322Z
