### ~~There seems to be some other ways to get this bug (e.g. by switching from a different app or home screen back to Discord which many people already reported).~~

~~That might increase the priority of the ticket because that is a much more realistic way to get the bug that happens by normal usage of the Discord app.~~

~~It seems that this way of getting the bug is exclusive to **non** Face ID devices.~~

**Edit:** A new ticket was created for that issue here https://trello.com/c/Q1xqNR2k - Pascal on 2019-06-20T19:10:42.460Z
