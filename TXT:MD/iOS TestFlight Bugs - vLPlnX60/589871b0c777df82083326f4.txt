### I can no longer reproduce this as tapping on someone in a voice channel no longer opens their profile and it opens up the connection page as well. By the time that opens, everytime I've tried the user has loaded.

I'm willing to bet that if you could do it fast enough it would still crash, but at the moment I can't reproduce it. - Jared on 2018-04-03T21:41:04.884Z
