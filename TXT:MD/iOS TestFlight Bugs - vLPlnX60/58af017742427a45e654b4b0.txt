### (Per üçÅ Ghoul üçÅ#4567) Extension to issue: Going to All tab => Swiping left => More option then tapping Block (instead of Delete as per original steps, which seems to be fixed) makes you unable to scroll until tapping another random profile in the list once. Issue seems to be present since at least 1.9.1, build 524.
