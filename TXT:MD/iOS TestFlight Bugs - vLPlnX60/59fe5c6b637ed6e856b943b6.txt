Reported by Pascal#0929

####Steps to reproduce:
- Send a message and add some reactions for it 
- Now pin this message or search for this message 
- Open the pinned/searched message and go to the chat preview by clicking on this message 
- Click on the current reactions to add or remove one

####Expected result:
You should see that your reaction was added or removed.
####Actual result:
You won't see any change for the reactions in the chat preview but opening the chat directly will show it. So just a visual bug.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 1.10.0 (1476)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s with iOS 11.1 & iPad Air 2 with iOS 11.2 PB 1

### I can reproduce and the reporter has attached a screenshot. After opening pinned messages, you need to tap on the message and then attempt to remove or add a reaction.
