####Steps to reproduce:

- Open iOS Wallet app in your iPhone 
- Select a boarding pass or any other card you can share (e.g. iTunes Pass), click '...' on top right, click 'Share Pass' 
- Select Discord to share the pass

####Expected result:
Discord should somehow embed the boarding pass in the message.
####Actual result:
Discord just presents an empty message template failing to embed the boarding pass, with 'Send' button greyed out. Adding some text enables the 'Send' button, but only sends that text. Other available apps in the list 'iOS messages, Whatsapp' can embed & share the boarding pass.
####Client settings:
3.1.0
####System settings:
iOS 12.4, iPhone 7
