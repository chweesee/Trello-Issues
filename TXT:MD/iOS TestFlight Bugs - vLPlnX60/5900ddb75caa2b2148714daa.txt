### Verified. You can do this with any link, even if you're already in the server. - Jared on 2017-05-02T21:51:31.993Z

### Verified this issue still occurs except instead of hanging it's now a hard crash. - Jared on 2018-01-08T17:12:46.631Z


### This doesn't appear to be hard crashing or hanging anymore, but it does bring us back to search -- when search is dismissed, we will be in the other guild. - Andy Garron on 2018-01-24T23:38:34.151Z


### Can reproduce.
unfortunately as of TestFlight 2.2.6 (3373) I can now reproduce this. iPod Touch 6th generation, iOS 11.2.6, TestFlight 2.2.6 (3373)
