### The two icons in the top right corner of any server, (the user list icon and the search server icon, are not labeled with voiceover.

Gar#1865 - Bug Bot on 2019-05-29T23:00:06.654Z


### (iPad specific?)
1. Double tap the user list icon in the top right of any server to bring up the user list.
2. Double tap the icon once again to collapse the user list.
3. Tap on any server on the left hand side of your screen once to move voiceover focus to the server list.
4. Swipe right repeatedly.
5. Voiceover will end up back in the user list, even though the user list is hidden.

### Please ignore my most recent comment as there was an error in it, and instead refer to this revised version.
(iPad specific?)
1. Double tap the user list icon in the top right of any server to bring up the user list.
2. Double tap the icon once again to collapse the user list.
3. Tap on any channel on the left hand side of your screen once to move voiceover focus to the channel list.
4. Swipe right repeatedly.
5. Voiceover will end up back in the user list, even though the user list is hidden.

### The icon in the bottom left hand corner which allows you to manually enter a channel name, then brings up results matching that name in various servers is not labeled with voiceover. I would imagine it should be labeled something like "Go to channel button."

### dm call button does not provide auditory feedback

### Opening a users profile through the member list creates 2 voiceover elements, one covering everything above the users profile picture, one highlighting the horizontal band around the part of the pfp that extends above the profile tab, the upper one contains ‚Äúpossible text as family <username/game name/Spotify>‚Äù depending on the users playing status but should not contain any text bc it is highlighting then grayed out member list/chat area

### If you type : and a character to open the emoji keyboard. Selecting the text or the emote image will play the ‚Äúyou cant swipe that way‚Äù sound and not allow you to swipe to another element, selecting the entire row of info (emote image, emote name & gray bar to the right of it) allows you to swipe freely and will not swipe to these individual elements

binchlord#0998 - Bug Bot on 2019-05-30T11:02:42.287Z


### iOS voiceover scrolls down when you swipe up and vice versa. Discord server/member/channel/dm lists do the same. In channels and dms the response is reversed.

binchlord#0998 - Bug Bot on 2019-05-30T11:03:11.711Z


### Swiping right through the open dms list will sometimes hop onto the online status/quick switcher tab and not allow you to continue scrolling through dms (on iPad it sometimes hops onto the paper clip or emote icons in the chat area)

binchlord#0998 - Bug Bot on 2019-05-31T03:53:16.473Z


### The change status icon i.e the icon that lets you set yourself as online, away, do not disturb, or invisible is not labeled. In addition it is impossible to determine which of the options in that menu is selected, as voiceover does not say for instance "Online, selected."

Gar#1865 - Bug Bot on 2019-05-31T06:34:11.180Z


### roles you do not have permission to edit or open the serverwide permissions for will give no indication of why the menu cannot be opened & just keep reading the role name

### in channel/dm search, the clear text field button, next page button and clear history button do not provide auditory feedback

binchlord#0998 - Bug Bot on 2019-06-02T13:43:08.670Z


### While scrolling through the server list, it is impossible to tell which server one is currently in by using voiceover. For example while in the Discord Testers server, voiceover should say something like, "Discord Testers, selected." Instead, it simply says "Discord Testers." This also applies to both channels and DM's.

Note: I am aware you can tell simply by looking at the top of the screen, but I'm referring to the server/channel/dm list specifically.

### all f the text fields on the login and register screens are labeled, e-mail, password etc. However, none of them actually indicate that they are textfields that one can edit.

Gar#1865 - Bug Bot on 2019-06-09T00:31:56.294Z


### The element used to change your profile picture in settings, as well as the buttons that appear after you have selected a picture are not labeled. However, the latter do announce "button" when you go through them.

Gar#1865 - Bug Bot on 2019-06-11T03:31:29.071Z


### 1. Double tap the message text field to compose a message while in a server. (Ensure that you are using a bluetooth keyboard, not sure if this works without one but maybe someone else can test it.)
2. Place your finger on a channel or dm conversation on the left hand side of the screen.
3. Swipe right repeatedly.
Voiceover should read all elements as normal. Instead it skips directly to the photo picker and emoji picker, with no indication that any other elements exist.
IPad specific? IPad 6th gen, iOS 12.3.1, Discord Testflight 3.0.3 (15685)

Gar#1865 - Bug Bot on 2019-06-11T15:45:05.866Z


### In regards to my previous comment, I have retested this bug and found two additional things worth noting.
1. This is reproducible on my iPhone 6S.
2. A bluetooth keyboard is not required.

Gar#1865 - Bug Bot on 2019-06-11T16:33:22.944Z


### Voiceover does not distinguish between channel names and category names while swiping through the channel list in a server. It does not announce that one element is a channel and one is a category, which can make navigation quite confusing.

Gar#1865 - Bug Bot on 2019-06-11T16:35:20.365Z


### Can reproduce.
When creating a server, voiceover does not announce what region, is any, is selected by default. Nor does it do so after you have selected one, or if you are looking through the list in server settings.

Gar#1865 - Bug Bot on 2019-08-29T19:46:36.381Z


### After creating your own server voiceover correctly reads the welcome to your own server message. If you swipe right however there are two buttons which register as unlabeled. The first one seems to be, at a guess, the icon to allow you to set a custom image for your server. The second one seems to have something to do with sending invites.

Gar#1865 - Bug Bot on 2019-08-29T19:50:28.970Z


### When managing server settings, voiceover does not indicate what option is selected for default notification settings for all users.

Gar#1865 - Bug Bot on 2019-08-29T19:56:08.671Z


### When managing a server's moderation settings, voiceover does not announce which items are selected under the explicit content filter or verification status settings.

Gar#1865 - Bug Bot on 2019-08-29T20:02:56.169Z


### channel permission buttons are unlabeled and give no indication of which settings are currently enabled/disabled

binchlord#0998 - Bug Bot on 2019-08-30T13:49:49.722Z


### As of Discord 3.1.1 the following elements, and possibly more, can be confirmed as having been labeled:
Emoji keyboard icon
Change status icon
Quick switcher icon
Settings icon
View mentions icon
Attach files icon (labeled inaccurately, should be attach photo/video as that's about all you can attach on iOS).

Gar#1865 - Bug Bot on 2019-08-30T17:24:11.119Z


### The toggle drawer icon is also now labeled.

Gar#1865 - Bug Bot on 2019-08-30T17:25:12.490Z


### Can reproduce.
three dots button at top right of VC info that opens channel and voice settings is mislabeled as the ‚Äúclose button‚Äù

binchlord#0998 - Bug Bot on 2019-08-31T23:14:06.873Z


### As of the first build of Discord 3.1.2 all textfields related to logging in or registering an account on the main screen are labeled. However, the textfields themselves are misread as search fields rather than text fields.

Gar#1865 - Bug Bot on 2019-09-01T14:08:31.909Z


### If you double tap one of the fields in the logon screen, voiceover becomes stuck and will not allow you to swipe left or right directly, as if there are no further elements on the screen. However, dragging your finger allows you to find other elements and subsequently unsticks the voiceover curser so that swiping left or right works correctly.

Gar#1865 - Bug Bot on 2019-09-01T14:10:14.335Z


### After tapping on a field on the logon screen to edit it and unsticking the voiceover curser using the method laid out below, voiceover does not indicate that you are editing either the username or password field. In addition, any content within the field is not read out.

Gar#1865 - Bug Bot on 2019-09-01T14:12:48.250Z


### Within the logon screen, voiceover indicates that there is a button to clear any input from within a username/password field. However it mistakenly identifies the clear text element as being part of the textfield. Double tapping the field appears to do nothing thus clearing the username or password entered is not possible.

Gar#1865 - Bug Bot on 2019-09-01T14:14:38.784Z


### When you receive a direct message from another player and you come across the in-app banner which displays the message on the top of the screen, voiceover incorrectly states that the message is from a bot, and also stacks the word "settings" on the end of it. See below:
Message banner as read by voiceover:
"Boss BOT This is a test message. Settings"
Element as it should be read out:
"Boss: This is a test message."
Note that the reason the ":" is there is to add a pause so that a voiceover user can differentiate the person's name from the actual message.

Gar#1865 - Bug Bot on 2019-09-01T14:29:32.888Z


### In regards to my previous note about the way voiceover reads message banners, this also sems to carry over to message banners for server messages as well.
In this case, it reads the user's name, and the channel name, then says BOT, reads the message, then says settings.

Gar#1865 - Bug Bot on 2019-09-01T15:40:45.058Z


### As of the first beta of Discord 3.1.2 the clear search icon is labeled. The rest of the search related elements, clear search history, back, forward, still don't appear to be labeled.

Gar#1865 - Bug Bot on 2019-09-01T18:55:57.395Z


### The add server icon is now labeled correctly.

Gar#1865 - Bug Bot on 2019-09-01T18:56:36.761Z


### The mentions button is now labeled. However, the icons that clicking on that element displays are not.

Gar#1865 - Bug Bot on 2019-09-02T17:38:26.836Z


### As of Discord 3.1.2 build 17140, accessibility with voiceover seems to have regressed to a pre 3.1.1 state. None of the elements that were labeled in 3.1.1 appear to be labeled on my iPad 6th generation running iPad OS 13.1 public beta 1. In addition, when attempting to log in voiceover does not report the username and password fields as being elements.

Gar#1865 - Bug Bot on 2019-09-07T17:40:23.656Z


### Can reproduce.
iPhone 7 Plus - iOS 13.0 - TestFlight 3.1.4 (17524) - In the Friends tab, slightly down and to the left of ‚ÄúAdd by Id‚Äù, you can select a circular element that will read a server. Selecting slightly above ‚ÄúNearby Scan‚Äù will select a rectangle that reads ‚ÄúFind or start a conversation‚Äù
