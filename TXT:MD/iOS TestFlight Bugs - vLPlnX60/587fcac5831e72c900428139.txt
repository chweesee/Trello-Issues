### I can no longer reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). The mentions no longer opens with the absence of the @ symbol. I used iPad Air 1st Generation running iOS 11.4. 

Because I am no longer able to reproduce this bug, I am moving it to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-02T18:20:42.692Z
