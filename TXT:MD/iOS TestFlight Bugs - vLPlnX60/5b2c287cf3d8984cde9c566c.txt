### I can no longer reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5548), the text is no longer white nor bold. It looks like normal text, but seems to be a little dim which is something that I'd have to get used to. I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Developer Beta 2).

Because I am no longer able to reproduce this bug, I am moving this to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-06-30T01:49:46.882Z
