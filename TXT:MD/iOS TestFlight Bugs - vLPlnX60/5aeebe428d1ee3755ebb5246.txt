### This does looks like an extension of https://trello.com/c/8OtwCttz/630-error-message-for-nickname-change-not-possible-will-be-shown-for-all-server-members to me after a closer look. I'm going to come back to this later to make sure it's OK to archive permanently as an extension.  - Ghoul on 2019-02-16T16:30:42.059Z
