####Steps to reproduce:

- Write any message that has one line with text, and then multiple blank lines (more is better) 
- Send this message 
- Long press the message and try to delete or pin it 
- Observe the modal window

####Expected result:
Delete/pin modal should get a scroll bar when then content exceeds the screen.
####Actual result:
When the messsage has too many blank lines the buttons for this modal could disappear and you have to restart Discord to close it.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.2.5 (2798)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s & iPad Air 2, iOS 11.3 PB 3
