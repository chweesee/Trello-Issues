### I can no longer reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). The image no longer flickers, but will stay the same as if nothing happened. I have tested it with multiple images on iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2).

Because I was not able to reproduce this bug, I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-03T01:52:25.076Z

### Can reproduce.
I can still reproduce this with images and gif reactions, iPhone 8 Plus - iOS 11.4, iPad Air 2 - iOS 12 Public Beta 2, TestFlight 2.3.4 (5616)

### Upon being poked by Pascal#0929 regarding this ticket, and being explained of the extension as well me wanting to try something. I can now reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5616) on iPhone 8 +, running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 3).

Upon talking with Pascal, it's fair to say that I feel like this ticket should be updated to reflect the more proper reproduction steps as I was not able to reproduce previously by adding one reaction. So I will update the ticket for the remaining case.

I am also moving it back to Verified Bugs. - Ghoul on 2018-07-08T16:47:33.794Z

### Can reproduce.
if the message that‚Äôs being reacted to is an embed with an image, the image will rapidly zoom in and out, zooming in enough to far exceed the extents of the screen and cover other elements
