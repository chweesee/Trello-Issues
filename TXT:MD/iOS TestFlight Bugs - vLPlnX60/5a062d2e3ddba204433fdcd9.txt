### Verified issue still occurs as written. - Jared on 2018-01-08T18:42:15.896Z


### Cannot reproduce anymore as of TestFlight 2.5.2 (13014) with iPhone 8 Plus running iOS 12.2. The app still reloads but that is intended and happens with other iOS apps too. If I come back to the app, I will get automatically reconnected to the call
