Reported by wild binary#0802

####Steps to reproduce:
- get light mode, go on your server's settngs 
- manage your roles, press on a role 
- edit permissions from that role, the 'roles' and 'done' buttons blend with the white from the light mode and are hard to find

####Expected result:
black text should appear with the two options: 'roles' and 'done'
####Actual result:
the two options look invisible as they blend with the light mode colour.
####Client settings:
testflight (ios) discord v1.9.2
####System settings:
ipad mini 4 with ios 10.3.2 and my trusty little iphone 5c with ios 10.3.3
