### I can no longer reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). The profile has since been redesigned, and the nickname still goes into a new line, but fits more nicely into the box.

I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2). Since I was not able to reproduce this, I am moving it to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-03T01:09:38.980Z
