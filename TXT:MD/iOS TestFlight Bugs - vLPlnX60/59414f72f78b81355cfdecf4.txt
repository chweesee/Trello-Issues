### Can reproduce.
CR with pages 5, 10, 16, 31, 53, 56, 56, etc (I got tired of going through at that point) might be lazy loading though I'm not sure  iPhone 7 iOS 10.2.1, Discord 1.8.3

### I am seeing the exact same number of responses on iOS and desktop. I have a feeling this bug was reported while we were having that bug that made some channels disappear on iOS, which means results from those hidden channels wouldn't have been counted. - Jared on 2017-06-19T22:39:18.935Z

### Can reproduce. Very strange. It's only specific pages and looking at the same results on desktop, there's nothing strange in there. You can individually search for all of those messages on Discord iOS and they'll appear as expected. - Jared on 2017-11-06T23:21:25.764Z

### Reliable repro is searching e.g. `something` and having the **non-emoji** string `:something:` appear in the results. - Michael Fong on 2018-01-26T22:29:14.068Z


### Can reproduce.
iPhone 6s, iOS 11.2.5 & iPad Air 2, iOS 11.3 PB 1 | TestFlight 2.2.1 (2236) | It crashes now, test it with page 21 for example

### I can still reproduce, the app even crashed for me when I got to page 71 or so.

### I can no longer reproduce with the steps provided by Meishu, searching for Dabbit in Discord Feedback from a new account doesnâ€™t cause a crash either. 

However, I still crash if I search emoji in Discord Testers and go to page 50+.

### That page 50+ is prob a diff issue. - Fanghao on 2018-02-07T02:39:21.739Z
