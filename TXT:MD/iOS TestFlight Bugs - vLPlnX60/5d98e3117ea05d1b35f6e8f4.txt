####Steps to reproduce:
- Open a DM with a user 
- Click on the 3 lines in the top left corner, so you get sent to the DM list 
- Have the user send you a message, so you receive a notification 
- Click on ''Find or start a new conversation'' at the very top of the DM list 
-  Open a new DM with a user you currently do not have in your DM list 
- Observe how the notifications from the previous person disappear.

####Expected result:
The notifications should remain, like they do if you do these exact same steps with a user currently in your DM list on the ''Find or a start a new conversation''-step.
####Actual result:
The notifications disappear.
