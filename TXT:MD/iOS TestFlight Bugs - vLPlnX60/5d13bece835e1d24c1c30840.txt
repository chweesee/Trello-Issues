Add a `!canrepro` to this ticket if you find any places with **performance issues** in this build and describe where and how the issue happens.

Something you can add here are these kind of issues:

- The app being slow
- The app taking a long time to respond to an input
- Unclean scrolling (like when you scroll, it bumps up and down a million of times)
- Lag in an area, like emojis, server members, etc.

Crashes are **not** something that should be added and should always get their own new ticket.

### Can reproduce.
Saving an image to your photo library for the first time or after a restart, takes notably more time than subsequent attempts of saving it. | Steps to Reproduce: - Restart Discord - Go to a chat where there are images you can save - Open an image - Tap three dots on top right - Save to Camera Roll  - NOTE: Observe how long it takes; now try saving it again and see that it takes much less time. Try with different images if needed. iPhone 7 Plus, iOS 13 DB2
