### Can reproduce.
Upon testing, it seems VoiceOver functionality as a whole is severely broken on landscape iPads with a vast amount of unselectable elements - it simply does not work. On iPhones & portrait iPads, elements do not work as expected, including being unable to send messages. iPhone 7: iOS 13.4.1; TestFlight 21.0 (19848) & iPad 7: iPadOS 13.4.1; TestFlight 21.0 (19848)

### One cannot also scroll through the channel message history... the channel history is not being read to the user (it's detecting channel name elements behind the screen?)... cannot search in channels anymore... cannot select the member list icon (have to use the channel name) to which it seemingly traps you there... cannot open the message box because it's not a selectable element unless you tap some random area around it that opens it which seemingly is not related... the attachment, gift, emoji buttons don't open either and the send message button is not selectable so one cannot send messages

### To stress on iPad landscape - Literally nothing is selectable. Server list, channel list, server name, account settings, recent mentions, quick switcher, invite button, direct messages, channel name at the top of the channel, send messages, emoji/gift/attachment/message text area, search icon, member list, nothing. The member list can be accessed because VoiceOver seemingly detects the channel name hidden behind the screen to which you are again locked out

### I can reproduce this on the following builds of TestFlight 21.0: 19848 & 19831 & 19807. But, I cannot reproduce this on TestFlight 20.0 (19811)
