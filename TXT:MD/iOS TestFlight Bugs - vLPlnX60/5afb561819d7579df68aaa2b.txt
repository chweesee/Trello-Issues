- Tap the 1Password icon at the right of the password field

it should open the share sheet where I can choose my password manager to automatically enter my credentials
####Actual result:
the app crashes (the screen goes black for a short moment and then I'm back on my homescreen)
####Client settings:
iOS Testflight 2.3.2 (4460)
