### This bug seems to have been fixed with an OTA update (maybe?) as i can no longer reproduce this bug on iPhone 6, iOS 12.2 (dev beta 4) - Stable 2.5.0

### Seems this issue is now occuring with bot embeds, so instead of having someone sent an image, you’ll have to make a bot send an embed with an image
