Reported by Nick Crompton#7090

####Steps to reproduce:
- Load discord on an iPad running 10.0 or later 
- (There could be an issue with this as it only happens to me in 1 server so I'm going to specifically say the servers name) Click on the LGBTQ+ Lounge OR 
- Wait 5-10 mins, click on the server and try to view the members list by swiping to the left. Now I don't know if it only happens on that lgbtq+ server or it also happens to others that are not in the server

####Expected result:
Discord shows you the members of that server
####Actual result:
Discord starts to reload OR  discord completely crashes and kicks you out.
####Client settings:
1.8.8
####System settings:
iPad Air 2 iOS 10.0

### Alright, after a _lot_ of research, I determined that this bug is actually a dupe of https://trello.com/c/fKcqk6eg/217-crash-when-viewing-sidebar-in-channel

I verified this by the LGBTQ+ Lounge and asking them to remove the multiple spaces from the channel topic, at which point the crash was resolved. - Jared on 2017-10-26T21:22:20.877Z
