####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a new category with at least 20 characters. 
- Create a new text channel in that category. Length of name is not important. 
- Go to Notification Settings. 
- Scroll down to Notification Overrides. 
- Create an override for that text channel, that is in the category.

####Expected result:
The box seperating the overrides should expand, making space for the category with a long name.
####Actual result:
The box around the override doesn't expand, making the text overlap existing overrides.
####Client settings:
2.1.2
####System settings:
iPhone 5s, iOS 10.0.1
