####Steps to reproduce:
- Join a VC.
- While still connected to the VC, exit the Discord app and make a phone call.
- End the phone call, and go back to Discord.


####Expected result:
After the phone call, VC should work fine and just allow you to speak and hear everyone else in it
####Actual result:
I can't hear my friends speaking in VC, even though I can see the voice circle around their pfp light up
####Client settings:
Discord TestFlight 1.9.1
####System settings:
iPhone 5S iOS 9.3.2
