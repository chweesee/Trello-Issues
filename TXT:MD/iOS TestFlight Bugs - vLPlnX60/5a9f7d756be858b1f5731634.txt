Reported by Pascal#0929

####Steps to reproduce:
- Post a very long message in a text chat 
- Scroll back so far that only part of the previously submitted message is visible 
- While keeping this chat position go to another account 
- Now add a reaction for this message with the other account

####Expected result:
Chat should keep position and not automatically scroll back in message history.
####Actual result:
It won't keep the position.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.2.5 (2894)
####System settings:
