### Can reproduce.
CR: iPhone 7 Plus, TestFlight 2.3.0 (3740), iOS 11.3 - I originally denied bug w/ a CNR, but it now appears it is almost always reproducible. Potentially a server-side issue.

### Can reproduce.
CR, iPhone 5s, iOS 10.0.1, TestFlight 2.3.0 (3817); Ghoul couldn't repro on this version though, so that should probably be looked into (her specs at the CR down below, just with the new version)

### I can no longer reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). I can see my Nitro badge just fine without any issues. I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Developer Beta 2) and iPad Air 1st Generation running iOS 11.4.

Because I was not able to reproduce this bug, I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-02T20:36:50.047Z
