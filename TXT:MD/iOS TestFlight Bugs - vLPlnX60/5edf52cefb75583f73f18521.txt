####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a desktop and mobile client side by side. 
- Mute a channel on your mobile app, you'll see that channel is also muted on desktop app. 
- Unmute the channel and you'll see that channel is not unmuted.

####Expected result:
Unmuting a channel has to be synced with desktop client. Also unmuting from desktop client has to be synced with mobile app.
####Actual result:
When you mute a channel it is synced with desktop app but unmuting is not. Mute a channel from your mobile app and you'll see channel is muted on desktop client. But unmuting a channel is not working, when you unmute the muted channel, it will stay muted on desktop.  Also when you remove the mute from your desktop, it is not synced with mobile -'notification' icon remains same-.
####Client settings:
Stable, 24.0
####System settings:
iPhone 5s, iOS 12.4.4
