####Steps to reproduce:
- Prerequisite: Enable the Japanese keyboard by going to General > Keyboard > Add new keyboard Open discord and swipe right to open the server list 
- Tap on the search in a server.
- Tap/hold on the globe icon and change your keyboard to the Japanese one 
- Type in a character or two 
- Observe

####Expected result:
The server search should work properly with the Japanese keyboard and allow you to convert it to katakana or kanjis. The suggestion/auto-complete should also appear
####Actual result:
The suggestion/auto-complete bar appears for a split second before disappearing  and you can't convert your input to katakana or kanji

### While I was not able to reproduce this bug with quickswitcher. I am indeed still able to reproduce with the server search on iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2) with Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5425). 

It is happening with the following keyboards:
- Japanese Romaji
- Japanese Kana

Because I was able to reproduce with server search, I have edited the ticket and will be moving to Reopened for the remaining case. - Ghoul on 2018-06-26T21:28:09.714Z
