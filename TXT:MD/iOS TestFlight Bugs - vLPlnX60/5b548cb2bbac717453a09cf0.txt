####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure you have Manage Server permission but you are not the owner 
- Open server settings 
- Go to the "Security" menu

####Expected result:
The "Security" menu shouldn't be visible because you have no permission to change anything there.
####Actual result:
It is always with manage server or admin permissions visible even though you are not the owner.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.3.6 (6000)
####System settings:
iPhone 8 Plus - iOS 11.4.1, iPad Air 2 - iOS 12 Public Beta 3

### Verified with iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 - Dev Beta 6 with iOS TestFlight 2.3.6 (6427). I can see the security menu even if I only had Manage Server permission and nothing else.
