Reported by Rashaun#9295

####Steps to reproduce:
- Close out of Discord entirely 
- Open up Discord 
- Type the first part of several emotes (for example, "blob" or "meow" because of the amount of emotes with that in the name) 
- Wait for the emote previews to load in 
- After the previews load in, type one more letter 
- Observe the emote previews

####Expected result:
Emote previews switch to the new emote choices that appear
####Actual result:
The previous emote previews stay for several seconds before switching
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.3.4 (5548)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s iOS 12 Public Beta
