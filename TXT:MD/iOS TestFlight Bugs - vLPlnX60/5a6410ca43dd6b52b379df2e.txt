### Cannot reproduce. I need specific emojis this happens with, a screenshot and a repro step that doesn't include the phrase "use your eyes" - Jared on 2018-01-22T19:47:13.738Z

### Added an image for it, the best way to see it to check the announcements channel in Discord Testers.

There you can observe the love emoji (like in the picture) for example.
