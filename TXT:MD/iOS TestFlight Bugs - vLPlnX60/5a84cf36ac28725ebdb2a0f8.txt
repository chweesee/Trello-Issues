### Can reproduce.
iPhone 6, iOS 11.2.5, TestFlight 2.2.3 (2617) | My experience is that you can not actually upload the pictures, but you can view them. Selecting a picture will open up the dialogue to post it, but the picture will not actually show up in the confirmation nor in the channel

### Checked up with this ticket as I've bumped into it. I am able to reproduce this bug on iOS 12 (Stable release, GM) on iPhone 8 + with iOS TestFlight 2.3.8 (7233).

So I updated my title to reflect that. - Ghoul on 2018-09-15T06:28:08.175Z


### Cannot reproduce anymore as of TestFlight 2.5.2 (13730) with iPad Pro 11" running iOS 12.2. I can no longer open the camera roll when the app doesn‚Äôt have permission for it.

Moving to Claimed Fixed list. - Pascal on 2019-04-13T09:27:51.684Z
