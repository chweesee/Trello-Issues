### Archiving this ticket due to inactivity for over 30 days. Though, I'd like to note that I tested this issue on iOS TestFlight 2.4.2 (10773) on iPhone XS Max running iOS 12.1.3 (Beta 4) and I was not able to reproduce this bug anymore. So in an sense, it's already fixed.

Spoke with IcyPebbles regarding it, and he said that it was fine archiving it for inactivity since it has been in Won't Fix for 30 days and it's fixed regardless. - Ghoul on 2019-01-22T22:46:49.689Z
