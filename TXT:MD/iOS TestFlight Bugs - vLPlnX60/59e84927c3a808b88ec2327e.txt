Reported by wild binary#0802

####Steps to reproduce:
- Split your screen in between Discord and another app.

- Go on the search magnifying glass.

- Search for a specific phrase, sentence (if you could find one) or keyword and look at your options.

- Now change the splitscreen split size. Change from a quarter of the screen to half of the screen.

####Expected result:
Everything on that page would fit and sync with your splitscreen size.
####Actual result:
The text for the search either gets cut off or does not extend to the multiscreen size. To make it fit, you have to search your specific phrase or thing again.
####Client settings:
TF iOS Discord 1.9.3 (1165)
####System settings:
iPad Mini 4, iOS 11.0.3.

### Can reproduce.
iPhone 6, iOS 11.1.2, TestFlight 2.2.1 (build 2202); seems to take a few tries after battling the new loading issues (not sure if they're a bug though) in the latest TF but will in the end put you in a different category to the one you swiped down to.
