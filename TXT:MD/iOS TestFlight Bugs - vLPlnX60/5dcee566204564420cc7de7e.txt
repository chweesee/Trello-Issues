####Steps to reproduce:
- Call someone in Direct Message (don’t mute yourself with the mute button when calling) 
- Tap on your profile icon to open the profile card 
- In voice settings, toggle mute to on 
- Close your profile card 
- Speak 
- Observe

####Expected result:
The green ring when speaking should not appear when mute is toggled on in the profile card and the mute button should appear (like if you were muting the other person using the steps).
####Actual result:
The green ring when speaking and the mute icon both show when mute is toggled on in the profile card.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.6 (18021)
####System settings:
iPhone 8, iOS 13.2

### This also seems to happen in server voice chats as well except that you don’t see the mute icon on the side but you do see the green circle.
