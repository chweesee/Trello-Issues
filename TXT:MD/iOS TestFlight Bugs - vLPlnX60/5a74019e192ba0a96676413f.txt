### Verified. I had to restart discord and go to the channel for the crash to occur. - Mike Nisbet on 2018-02-08T19:19:32.927Z

### I had originally marked this a Verified Fixed, but after messing around with it a bit, I was still able to reproduce by pinning multiple message and then restarting the application. It crashed 100% on launch until I switched language on Desktop - Jared on 2018-03-19T17:47:49.390Z

### I can no longer reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). When I pin multiple times and restart the application, there is no form of crashing anymore. I used iPhone 8 +, running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2)

However, there is a remaining of this: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/391356859971534858/463459144360394763/image.png which I was told by a proof-reader that it was an translation issue with Romanian.

Because I am no longer able to reproduce this bug (at least with the crashing), I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed.
