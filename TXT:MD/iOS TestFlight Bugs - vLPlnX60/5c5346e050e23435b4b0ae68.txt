####Steps to reproduce:
- Have two accounts in a test server, one with all perms and the second with default everyone perms (The account with default perms is the one the bug happens on and should not be server owner) 
- With the account having all perms create a new category and keep it empty  
- Open the permission screen for that specific category and give the second account "Manage Channel" permission for this category only.  
- Switch to the second account  
- Notice how the category is displayed on PC and you can manage it but on iOS it's invisible

####Expected result:
You should see the category and be able to edit it's name or create text channels
####Actual result:
The category is not visible on iOS even if you have Manage Channel perms
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.4.4 (11007)
####System settings:
iPhone SE, iOS 11.1.2
