####Steps to reproduce:
- Be in a server where you have enough permissions so you have to scroll down in the server menu. 
- Scroll down to the very bottom and observe.

####Expected result:
There should be a tiny bit of padding below Copy ID/Server Emoji/ whatever is at the bottom.
####Actual result:
Whatever is at the bottom touches the bottom of the screen with no padding.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.10 (18871)
####System settings:
iPhone 8, iOS 13.3.1 Public Beta
