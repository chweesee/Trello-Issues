### Moved from User Reported Bugs to Chat rewrite bugs by Tarek on 2018-01-21T10:21:32.433Z


### Possible extension to this issue: Chat scrolls back in chat history when message gets deleted:

- Scroll back in the chat history in a chat with many messages
- Now delete any message
- Observe how the chat position changes automatically and scrolls a bit back
