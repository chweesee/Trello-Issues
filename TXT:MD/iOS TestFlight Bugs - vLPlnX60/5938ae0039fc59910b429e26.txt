Reported by Ryry013#9234

####Steps to reproduce:
 - Receive"manage roles" permission, and no other administrative permissions (especially without manage server) 
 - On iOS, view server settings 
 - Try to change basic server settings, such as verification level.

####Expected result:
Without manage server, you should not be able to edit server settings
####Actual result:
You should be able to edit some basic server settings such as verification level, but nothing will save because in the end you don't have manage server permission (so, this is just a visual bug). <http://i.imgur.com/vnO1ofA.png>
####Client settings:
iOS 1.8.7
####System settings:
iPhone 6S - 10.0.1
