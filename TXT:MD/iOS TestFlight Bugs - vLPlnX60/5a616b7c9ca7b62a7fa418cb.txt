Reported by Ghoul#4567

####Steps to reproduce:
- Update to 2.2.1 (2202) 
- Chat normally for about 30 minutes, maybe less. Use emotes, do normal things. Invite friends to server 
- Observe.

####Expected result:
TestFlight should work normally, like you could see the emote list, and the letters are not flying everywhere. Transition would be much more smoother
####Actual result:
TestFlight starts to malfunction in many ways, emote list being blank at first with words flying all over the keyboard and screen as messages are being sent, etc. will attach video (Seems to fix itself after crashing.)
####Client settings:
Discord TestFlight 2.2.1 (2202)
####System settings:
iPhone 8 +, iOS 11.2.5 (PB6)
