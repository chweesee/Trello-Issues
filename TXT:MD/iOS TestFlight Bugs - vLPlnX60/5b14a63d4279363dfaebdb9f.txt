####Steps to reproduce:
- Get on a server where you have no perms to edit channel. 
- As fast as you can, tap “message in (channelname)” and the top bar, the name of the channel leading you to channel settings. 
- May take few times to repro, you have to click the bar FIRST and then quickly the message before it transfers you. you should be able to edit channel topic.

####Expected result:
Nothing really, I just found this whilst trying to find bugs.
####Actual result:
Allows you to edit channel topic, thank god it doesn’t actually save though.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.3.2
####System settings:
iOS 11, iPad mini 2
