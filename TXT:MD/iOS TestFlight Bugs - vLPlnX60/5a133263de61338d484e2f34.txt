### I can no longer reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). I used my iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2) which is an faster device, but I also used my iPad Air 1st Generation running iOS 11.4 (which is an older and slower device.). I was not able to reproduce with either.

Because I was not able to reproduce anymore, I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-03T01:04:17.912Z
