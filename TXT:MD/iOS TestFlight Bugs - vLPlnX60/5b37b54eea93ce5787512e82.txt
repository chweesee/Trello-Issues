####Steps to reproduce:
- Use a spellchecker that will detect emotes as a mistake (the best is to not use English, I used French personally) 
- Type the first part of an emote 
- Click on a suggestion of the emote preview 
- Observe the correction done by the spellchecker 
- If you use too many times the emote, the spellchecker will learn it and will not "correct" it

####Expected result:
Once the person clicked on an emote suggestion, the correct emote code is typed in the text bar.
####Actual result:
The iOS spellchecker can "correct" the emote code and replace it by some words that it will find "correct".
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560)
####System settings:
iPhone 7, iOS 11.3
