Reported by ☘nickWtn☘#3789

####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a server with a long name  
- Find a invite to said server  
- Click on the invite link and observe what the join message box looks like

####Expected result:
the message should fit in the box and not overlap onto the background of the server invite
####Actual result:
It overlaps onto the two sides and can even obstruct the offline user box
####Client settings:
Stable 2.2.4
####System settings:
iPod Touch 6th generation, iOS 11.2.6

### Verified, but this is deliberate destructive behavior, so this is the lowest of the low priority. - Jared on 2018-02-23T23:15:37.104Z

### I can no longer reproduce as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560) on iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2). The join button now stays in one line, and will end in the three dots as it won't run all over the Online and Offline Member count.

Because I was not able to reproduce this bug, I am moving it to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-03T00:35:57.489Z
