####Steps to reproduce:
- Ask someone dm you a couple server link invites, (feel free to ask me send you the links) check your current server orders and then accept the invites one by one.  
- After accepting the invites, check the order of servers again. 
- Restart the app and observe any changes of server orders. 
- Note: This bug might happens randomly, try reproduce a several time, because this it's not only happening to me. another user also encountered this bug.

####Expected result:
server order doesn't change after you restart the app.
####Actual result:
server order changes randomly after restarting the app.
####Client settings:
2.3.1
####System settings:
iPhone 5s ios 11.3.1
