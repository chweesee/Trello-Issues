### I can reproduce this P3, moving to Verified Bugs.

Discord 2.2.0 (1910), iOS 11.2.1, iPhone 8 Plus - Alexandru Todea on 2017-12-15T19:34:53.936Z

### I can no longer reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). The keyboard now gets out of my way when I long press the user during typing out the emoji's name. I used iPhone 8 +, running iOS 12 (Developer Beta 2).

Because I am no longer able to reproduce this bug, I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-02T19:27:43.851Z
