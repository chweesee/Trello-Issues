Reported by Ghoul#4567

####Steps to reproduce:
- Send an still emote (Discord’s emote or custom emote) 
- Have someone to send an animated emote (by itself). 
- Observe what happens after you send it. 
- If for some reason, you cannot reproduce, try that method several times with multiple different emotes. Make sure you’re not using the iOS default emotes.

####Expected result:
Emote menu should stay down, and it looks like you’re not browsing emotes to use.
####Actual result:
Emote menu pops up randomly and you’re not even typing. (Also happens randomly with still emotes, but you’d also find yourself being unable to scroll the chat)
####Client settings:
Discord TestFlight 2.2.0 (2080)
####System settings:
iPhone 8+, iOS 11.2.5 (PB4)

### I wanted to explain that there has been issues related to the custom emotes in the past few months, but there hadn't been solid reproduction steps. It's not just the animated emotes that are having issues, but the normal emotes that brings the emote menu up is more random. 
However, when you send an normal emote, and someone else sends an animated emote which results into the emote menu popping up. I was able to reproduce that everytime, so I think those are pretty solid reproduction steps. It may take a couple of times to be able to reproduce this bug sometimes.

iPhone 6, iOS 11.1.2, TestFlight 2.2.0 (build 2080) - seemed to happen to me without any animated emoji, required a full app restart to get the emoji menu to go away.

### I can no longer reproduce, this seems to have been fixed with the introduction of working animated emojis on iOS.
