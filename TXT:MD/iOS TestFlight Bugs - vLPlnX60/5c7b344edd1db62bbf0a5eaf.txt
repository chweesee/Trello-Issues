####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure text size is on 4 in iOS settings 
- Go to server settings 
- Go to the members tab 
- Click on a user and hit kick 
- Observe how the message below it is cut off (If it doesn't work try a different user) 
- NOTE: I am aware that E8xHz9u9 exists, however I was unable to repro that on TestFlight 2.4.5

####Expected result:
The message shouldn't be cut off
####Actual result:
The message is cut off
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.4.5 (11624)
####System settings:
iPhone X, iOS 12.1
