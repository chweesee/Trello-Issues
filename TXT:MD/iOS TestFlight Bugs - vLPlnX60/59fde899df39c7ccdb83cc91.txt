Reported by Pascal#0929

####Steps to reproduce:
- Send a message with a linked image with unsecured connection (http)
- Click on this image to open the image preview

####Expected result:
You should see the image in the image preview.
####Actual result:
You will get an error "Failed to load the image. Please try again.". This problem only happens with unsecured links because uploading the same image to imgur (secured) and linking it will show it.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 1.10.0 (1476)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s with iOS 11.1 & iPad Air 2 with iOS 11.2 PB 1

### Here is the example http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/38093765071_045d50699f_o.jpg (when using https instead of http the image will be loaded, that could cause the issue)
