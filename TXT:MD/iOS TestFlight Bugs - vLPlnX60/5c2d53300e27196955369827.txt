####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a channel that you have permission to see and do things in (i.e Create Instant Invites but also permissions to manage the channel) 
- In **Channel Settings** for that channel, press **Permissions**  
- Press **Add member** and find your name, press it 
- Remove a permission node that should result in disallowing the permission node to you as well. 
- Press the **X** on the permission node one more time.

####Expected result:
The first time you press the **X** button that would disallow the feature for you, the modal saying *Pretty sure you don't want to do this* should come up and alert you.
####Actual result:
The first time you press the **X** button, the button actually enables the check mark, rather than opening the modal. And pressing the X button one more time, opens the modal as intended.
####Client settings:
Discord Testflight // Version 2.4.1 // Build 10225
####System settings:
iPad 6 // iOS 12.1.1 (Stable, noDev)
