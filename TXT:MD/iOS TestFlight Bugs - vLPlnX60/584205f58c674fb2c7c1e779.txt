Reported by dinos#0649

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Find/Send a link in chat 
- Hold on the URL, and start sliding either left or right 
- Make sure the darkened border (that indicates a link has been tapped is still visible) 
- Stop tapping 

####Expected result:
 The browser doesn't open since you're already sliding to another view 
####Actual result:
 The in-app browser opens, and the top bar is either too low, messing with the loading statusbar and other elements

### I think this is the same bug as https://trello.com/c/hn9Q4dS3/102-member-list-of-a-server-is-slightly-moved-over-closed-but-have-to-double-click-to-show and https://trello.com/c/6e2dy5IG/104-clicking-the-open-in-browser-link-for-an-image-clips-the-image-out-of-normal-constraints - Jared on 2016-12-08T19:11:32.701Z


### @jared627 Its same as second one. the first one is a bug in react native. - Fanghao on 2016-12-17T02:42:21.367Z
