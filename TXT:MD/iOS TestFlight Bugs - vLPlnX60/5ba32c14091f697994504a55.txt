####Steps to reproduce:
- Go into a channel with another user 
- Have the user send a message or two while you are actively viewing the channel on your phone (make sure you do not have any other devices set to this channel) 
- After the user sends a message or two, switch to a second channel and have the user send a message in the first channel (easier if you have another channel to communicate in while testing) 
- After they have sent another message or two, go back into the first channel 
- Make sure their messages are separated by the red "New Messages" line, and then send a message in that channel 
- After sending a message, observe the messages that the user had sent

####Expected result:
The messages from the other user are supposed to group
####Actual result:
The message from the other user do not group until you switch out of the channel and back in after you have sent a message
####Client settings:
