####Steps to reproduce:
- You were a nitro user 
- When you were a Nitro user you should have been on 2 servers (server A and server B) that had exactlty the same emoji name 
- You are no more a Nitro user, and you still are on server A and B 
- Go to server A, in whatever text channel 
- Click on emoji button 
- Scroll to server A emoji section 
- Choose the emoji which has the same name that the emoji on server B 
- There is a number showing up after the emoji name 
- If not, try on server B 
- When emoji is send, it doesn't show up as it recognize the emoji as the emoji of the other server

####Expected result:
Send the emoji and show it on the text channel
####Actual result:
We see only the text :example: and Clyde bot respond back that the emoji used is from another server
