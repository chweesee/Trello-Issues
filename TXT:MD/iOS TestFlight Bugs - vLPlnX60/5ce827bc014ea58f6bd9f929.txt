####Steps to reproduce:
- Load a server. 
- Slide to the left so the member list is open. 
- Interact / Scroll through chat (Chat box, search, the chat itself, or the channel name).

####Expected result:
You can do everything as you should (Type in chat, keyboard opens, scroll through chat, etc).
####Actual result:
It will boot you back to the server list view where you can actually do the actions above. Otherwise, everything is useless.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.0.2 (15173)
