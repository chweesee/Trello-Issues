####Steps to reproduce:
- Own a server 
- Transfer ownership to someone else (can be an alt for testing purposes) 
- Observe how the members list stays open 
- You can click the three dots in top right to prune/filter users 
- You can also click back and view the server settings, without modifying them.

####Expected result:
The server settings screen should be closed similarly to what it does on desktop.
####Actual result:
The server settings screen stays open.
####Client settings:
