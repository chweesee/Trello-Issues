Reported by Pascal#0929

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to your DMs 
- Click on the`Find or start a conversation` search there 
- Try to search for something (better to use only 1 or 2 letter with much results) and observe how the results appear 
- Also try to close the search while results are still loading

####Expected result:
Search should run smoothly and allow to instantly close it.
####Actual result:
Search is very unresponsive and needs long time to load the results. Also you can't close it while loading the results. The bug especially happens with the iPad version.
####Client settings:
Discord Stable 2.2.9
####System settings:
iPad Air 2, iOS 11.4 PB 1 & iPhone 6s, iOS 11.3

### I can no longer reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4, the search is still responsive and no longer needs a long period of time to pop up the results. I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 Dev Beta 2 and iPad Air 1st Generation running iOS 11.4.

Because I am unable to reproduce anymore, I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed.  - Ghoul on 2018-07-02T18:58:19.863Z
