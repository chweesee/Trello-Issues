####Steps to reproduce:
- Ensure you have icloud libary enabled. 
- take a screenshot or photo from another device (not the iphone) and let it sync within icloud 
- DO NOT OPEN  if the photo has been viewed once in there on ANY device, this will no longer work because the photo is downloaded locally 
- Go into a discord channel or DM, upload the photo (add a caption if you wish doesn't matter) 
- When you press submit the photo won't upload and process will crash 
- If you duplicate the photo within the share options you can now upload the photo fine.

####Expected result:
Photos should upload normally and similar to them being stored locally on the phone.
####Actual result:
The process will crash and photo won't upload.
####Client settings:
Discord 3.0.2 (15283)
####System settings:
Apple iPhone X iOS 12.4 (Build - 16G5038d) & iOS 13 Dev Beta 1 (Build - 17A5492t)
