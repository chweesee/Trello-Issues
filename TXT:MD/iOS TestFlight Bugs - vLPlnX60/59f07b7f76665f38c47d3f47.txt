Reported by Pascal#0929

####Steps to reproduce:

- Find a very long (the longer the better) message with some reactions 
- Scroll a bit in this channel (bug doesn’t work when you are at the end of the chat) 
- Try to add a reaction by clicking on present reactions (I would recommend to try it with the first row reactions)

####Expected result:
The chat position should stay when adding a reaction.
####Actual result:
It automatically scrolls up a bit and changes chat position.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 1.9.3 (1286)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s with iOS 11.0.3 & iPad Air 2 with iOS 11.1 PB 5

Can still reproduce, maybe this extra info here https://trello.com/c/scJRxDPW can help. Seems it is also limited to user messages, not working with bots.

### I can still reproduce this bug on iPhone 8 Plus running iOS 12 (Developer Beta) with Discord Stable 2.3.3. The chat automatically scrolls back a slightly. You will need to use Falco / Clayton's message in announcements in DTesters in order to reproduce. 

So because I was able to reproduce. I am moving this back to Reopened again.  - Ghoul on 2018-06-06T01:21:26.686Z

### I checked this ticket during the Trello Event and I am STILL able to reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). When I have the message with the emojis partly at the button, and I react with one of the emojis, my chat will automatically scroll up a bit. 

I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2), but I will leave this ticket where it is. - Ghoul on 2018-07-02T23:51:18.242Z

Can still Reproduce this on: iPhone 6, iOS 12 (dev beta 12) - Stable 2.3.7
