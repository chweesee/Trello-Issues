### I can no longer reproduce on iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2) with Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5425). Everytime I misspell a word, the autocorrect will attack me as described in the Expected Result.

Because I was not able to reproduce, I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-06-26T18:53:43.563Z
