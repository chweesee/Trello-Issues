####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a spoiler with a custom emote hidden behind it. 
- Pin, unpin, or delete the spoiler.

####Expected result:
The custom emote is supposed to be hidden.
####Actual result:
Upon asking confirmation for pinning, unpinning, or deleting the message, the custom emote is not hidden behind the spoiler, in a smaller sized spoiler box surrounding the emote, assuming you've also added more spoiler content that isn't a custom emote.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.4.2 (10773)
####System settings:
iPhone X, iOS 12.1.3 (Dev Beta 4)
