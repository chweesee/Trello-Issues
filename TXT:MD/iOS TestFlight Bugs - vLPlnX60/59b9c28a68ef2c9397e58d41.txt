### This is not a bug. It's setting the permissions for any channel you move into that category by default. So what settings a voice channel should have if you move it into the category. - Jared on 2017-09-18T21:03:32.787Z

### This is a bug. All text channel permissions like `Send Messages`, `Manage Messages` etc. and the permission `Read Text Channels & See Voice channels` are missing.  For Desktop version they are shown.
