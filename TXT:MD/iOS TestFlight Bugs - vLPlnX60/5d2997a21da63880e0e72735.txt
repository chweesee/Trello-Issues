Add a `!canrepro` to this ticket if you find any places with **performance issues** in this build and describe where and how the issue happens.

Something you can add here are these kind of issues:

- The app being slow
- The app taking a long time to respond to an input
- Unclean scrolling (like when you scroll, it bumps up and down a million of times)
- Lag in an area, like emojis, server members, etc.

Crashes are **not** something that should be added and should always get their own new ticket.
