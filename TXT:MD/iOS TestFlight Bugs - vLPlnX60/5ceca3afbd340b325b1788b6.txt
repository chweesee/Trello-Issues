Reported by Kenai#5153

####Steps to reproduce:
- Connect your phone to a device that displays call status(it also does this on the CallKit screen when connected to a device other than the watch) (ex: radio, watch.) 
- Make a call on discord.

####Expected result:
Call should connect then start a timer showing the length of the call.
####Actual result:
The timer for the call never starts and the CallKit screen says “connecting...” forever. Any connected devices exhibit similar behavior with discord and never start the timer.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.0.2
####System settings:
iPhone 8, iOS 12.4, also happens on 12.3
