####Steps to reproduce:
- Drag a server icon quickly between the other icons and observe how it moves slower than your finger to allow for the reordering animation 
- Drag the icon to the top (above the the DM/friends icon and observe that it is delayed, like when moving between other server icons 
- Drag to the very bottom of the server list and drag over the button to create/join a server and observe how the movement of the icon you're dragging is synchronised with the location of your finger in real time, unlike it was in the previous 2 steps

####Expected result:
Dragged server icons should move at a consistent speed regardless of where they are
####Actual result:
Server icon movement speed varies depending on where the icon is
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.4.0 (8921)
####System settings:
iPhone XS Max, iOS 12.1.1 Dev Beta 3
