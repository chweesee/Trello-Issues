iPhone 8 Plus, iPad Air 2 - iOS 12 Public Beta 7, TestFlight 2.3.7 (6870) - The reporter is talking about recent images, also it seems only to happen with spave-saving versions of your images. So you have to enable the option "Optimize iPhone Storage" in your settings and get this:

"Your library is optimized only when you need space, starting with the photos and videos you access least."
