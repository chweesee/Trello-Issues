Reported by üçÅ juj üçÅ#5114

####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure HEIF (High Efficiency) format is enabled in Camera => Formats. Using default Camera app with Live Photo on, default Photo mode. 
- Take a picture in the Camera app. 
- Go to Photos app and edit the picture you just took, seemingly any edit (cropping a bit, rotating, auto tune etc) works, then save the edit with Done. 
- Upload the just edited picture with Paperclip => Tap the picture in the recent list there. Browsing the picture in Camera Roll won't produce the issue.

####Expected result:
(Edited) Picture uploads in full size format, like it would unedited (or as it does for non-HEIF pictures, or pictures browsed from Camera Roll, even edited).
####Actual result:
The resulting uploaded image is a tiny thumbnail, usually a 120 x 90 sized picture.
####Client settings:
Discord TestFlight 2.0.1 (Build 1610)
####System settings:
iPhone 8 Plus, iOS 11.2 (PB4)
