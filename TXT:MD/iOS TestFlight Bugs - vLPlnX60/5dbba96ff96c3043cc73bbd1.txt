####Steps to reproduce:
- Pair a mouse with a scroll wheel to your iPad Pro over Bluetooth (options are under Accessibility > Assistive Touch) 
- Launch the Discord app 
- Navigate to a channel on a server with enough channels that scrolling through the channel list is possible 
- Use the mouse wheel to scroll through the list; notice that when you push the top of the scroll wheel away from you, you scroll down (this is the iOS default) 
- Use the mouse wheel to scroll through the message history in the channel

####Expected result:
Scrolling in all areas of the app should behave identically and match the iOS default (pushing the top of the scroll wheel away from you should scroll down)
####Actual result:
Scrolling is reversed; pushing the top of the scroll wheel away from you scrolls up, which is the opposite of the behaviour in the channel list and other pages and is not the iOS default
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.4 (17524)
####System settings:
iPad Pro 12.9‚Äù 64GB (2018), iPadOS 13.1.2, Logitech Triathlon M720 connected over Bluetooth
