### I checked this ticket during the Trello Event, but I am still able to reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). I selected five photos with text to be sent, but unfortunately only one picture was sent. :(

I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 Dev Beta 2. I will leave this ticket as I am still able to reproduce. - Ghoul on 2018-07-03T00:30:47.231Z

### It seems still to happen, test it with more images and you should see the issue. Uploading more than 8 images only shows some of it but not all

### Also happens with the pasting images feature

Tested it with 10 images. The extension below would be a missing feature.
