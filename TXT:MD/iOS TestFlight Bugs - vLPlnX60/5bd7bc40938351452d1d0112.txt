####Steps to reproduce:
- Create an invite link to a voice channel for a server you're in 
- Send the invite in another server or DM so that it isn't in that channel 
- Completely close and restart the app after going to the second channel 
- Reopen Discord to the channel where you posted the invite link 
- Tap on the "Joined" button to enter the server you made the invite for 
- Observe the server after you get moved to it 
- Attempt to send a message, and observe what happens 
- Note: On desktop, you're given the option to load more messages, but that option is missing on iOS

####Expected result:
You join the voice channel, and see the messages in the top channel
####Actual result:
You don't join the voice channel, and the top channel appears blank and you can't load messages, and any messages you send will disappear until you switch channels
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.4.0 (8667)
