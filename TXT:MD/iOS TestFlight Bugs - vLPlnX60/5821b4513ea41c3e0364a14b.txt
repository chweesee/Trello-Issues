Reported by Dougley#6248

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Long-press on a webhook's message 
- Select user settings 

####Expected result:
 Either user settings is not there or it does nothing. 
####Actual result:
 It appears as if you're able to ban/kick the webhook and DM it, trying to DM it will result in an empty Group DM, and trying to ban it will bring up the ban modal. 
####Client version:
 Latest testflight, iPhone 5 iOS 10.1.1
