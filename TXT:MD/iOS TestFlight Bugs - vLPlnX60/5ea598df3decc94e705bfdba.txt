####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a server owner/mod to create a read-only channel. (You must be unable to type) 
- In any DM, type something random and do not send it. 
- Whilst in DM, let the owner/mod send a message in said channel. (banner notifications has to be enabled) 
- Click on the message notification from said owner within the App. 
- You'll hop to said channel, close the application and re-launch it again.

####Expected result:
You'd have a blank text tab says "Channel is read-only"
####Actual result:
Your entire draft-text from the DM gets converted in this Channel draft-stuck forever. Can't send or delete.
####Client settings:
17.0
####System settings:
iPhone X, iOS 13.4.1

### **Extension of this**
- Go to any text channel
- Send an invite to a read-only channel (Important: It must be a server that you’ve already joined) 
- Type some text in the chat box 
- While the keyboard is on-screen, tap the invite embed (not the invite link) - When you enter the server, you should see the send button is now white instead of gray 
- Go to another channel or server then come back to the read-only channel - Observe the result.

### Could be similar to typing text in a channel and then having your send messages permission revoked.
