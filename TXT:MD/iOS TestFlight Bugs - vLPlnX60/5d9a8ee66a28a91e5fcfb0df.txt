Reported by Pascal#0929

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to your iOS settings (General –> Keyboard) and make sure that keyboard shortcuts are enabled 
- Go to your Friends list 
- Click on "Add by ID" 
- Make sure the virtual keyboard is opened (you can also switch to the emoji keyboard to get the bug) 
- Rotate your device back to landscape mode (1 or 2 rotations needed, depending on the initial orientation)

####Expected result:
Keyboard should get closed when rotating or shouldn’t overlap with the text field.
####Actual result:
Keyboard overlaps with the text field making you not able to see what you type.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.4 (17524)
####System settings:
iPad Pro (11-inch), iPadOS 13.1.2
