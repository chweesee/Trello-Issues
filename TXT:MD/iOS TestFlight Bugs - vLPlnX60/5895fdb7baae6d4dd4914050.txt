####Steps to reproduce: 
- Go to any text channel 
- Send `:six:` 
- Confirm it looks normal on desktop 
- Send the six emoji from the symbols tab on the emoji keyboard 

####Expected result:
 Both messages, typed and emoji, look the same on both ends. 
####Actual result:
 The typed one shows up fine, but the emoji just sent shows up improperly to desktop users. 
####System settings:
 iPhone SE, iOS 10.2, client 1.8.1.
