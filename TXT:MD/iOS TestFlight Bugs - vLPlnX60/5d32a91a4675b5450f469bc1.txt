You have the OTA update when the friends Counter below the DM icon disappears. - Pascal on 2019-07-20T10:02:21.179Z

### **Possible related** to that issue:

- Transparent server icons no longer have a grey background when clicking on them (it is purple now)
- The friends online counter below the DM icon is missing - Pascal on 2019-07-20T23:18:46.931Z
