### Can reproduce.
CR, had something similar happen a few days ago trying to share stuff from Reddit to discord, where if I change the location the share extension would just close, that being said it fixed itself on its own so this might to. iPod Touch 6th generation, iOS 11.4.1, TestFlight 2.3.7 (6807)

### can repro on iphonex, ios 11.0.1, testflight 2.3.7 (6930), repro steps in ticket aren't consistent, but the issue happens fairly frequently.  - Clayton on 2018-08-25T00:57:22.996Z


### The issue happens with any kind of media and links you wanna share directly from Discord to Discord app.

### Can reproduce.
Can verify what Pascal said below and can reproduce the report itself. For some odd reason, I can only reproduce this outside of Discord if I am on 3G. However, 3G & 4G doesn't seem to matter within the Discord app itself. Not sure if this is helpful or not. iPhone 7: iOS 13.2.3; TestFlight 3.1.8 (18423)
