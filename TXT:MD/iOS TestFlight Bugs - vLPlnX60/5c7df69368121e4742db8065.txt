Reported by ZX ////#3405

####Steps to reproduce:
- Set up a server with an NSFW channel 
- Have a bot or someone ping you in said channel 
- Open the @mentions menu 
- Click on a mention 
- Tap "Continue" or "Nope" repeatedly 
- Observe how you can't get in 
- Also observe how you can see the message, so theoretically you can view images

####Expected result:
You should be able to get in to see the channel and the entire message should be spoilered or something so you don't potentially see NSFW content
####Actual result:
You can see the message, and upon clicking it you can't see the entire channel
####Client settings:
Testflight 2.4.6 11741
####System settings:
iOS 12.1.4 // iPad 9.7"
