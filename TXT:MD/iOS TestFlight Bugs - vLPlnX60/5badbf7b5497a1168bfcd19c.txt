####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure you have your phone and a computer near you 
- Go into the channel with slowmode on both your phone and computer 
- Choose an image from your camera roll and have it ready in the inline image drawer 
- Send a message from your computer to trigger the slowmode cooldown 
- While the cooldown is counting down, try to send the image from your phone 
- Observe the cooldown and channel on your phone 
- You can also choose and send an image after triggering the cooldown on your computer to achieve the same results

####Expected result:
Send button is greyed out because the cooldown is going
####Actual result:
Discord allows you to send the image, even though it never uploads, and retriggers the cooldown on your phone instead of syncing with your computer
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.3.8 (7416) - Canary Build 24853
####System settings:
iPhone 6s iOS 12.1 Dev Beta - Windows 10 Home x64 1803
