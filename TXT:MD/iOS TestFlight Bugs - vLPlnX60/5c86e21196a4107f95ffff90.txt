Reported by Tiemen#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Put your device on silent with the physical switch 
- Make sure autoplaying GIFs is enabled 
- Post a GIF with sound in a channel, such as this one or if there's already one in the channel, make sure you're scrolled up to the message with the gif

####Expected result:
The sound from the GIF shouldn't be playing when your device is on silent, or preferably not at all since I don't think anyone wants to randomly hear sounds from gifs
####Actual result:
The sound from the GIF plays regardless if your device is on silent or not
####Client settings:
TF 2.4.6 (12026)
####System settings:
iPhone XS, iOS 12.2 dev beta 3

### Having your ringer switched to silent does not have any effect on this bug, because iOS keeps the ringer volume and phone volume (for apps and music) separate from each other

### Multiple Bug Hunters has reported that they are not able to reproduce this ticket anymore. Since I was not able to test on my own - I asked Xylium to go ahead and test. 
iPhone 6, iOS 12.3 (dev beta) - TestFlight 2.5.2 (12856) for me it doesn’t play sounds anymore even though i un-silent it

So moving to Claimed Fixed for confirmation. - Ghoul on 2019-03-28T19:56:46.893Z
