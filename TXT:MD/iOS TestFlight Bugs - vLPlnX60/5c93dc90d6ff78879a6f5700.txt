Reported by Arnold0#7514

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a gif that auto plays in a channel and look for a message close to it you can search 
- Go into discord settings and turn gif auto play off if not already done 
- Search for that message close to the gif 
- Click on the result and in the small chat history that opens find the message with the gif 
- Notice how the gif is auto playing when it should not

####Expected result:
The gif should not auto play as gif auto play is turned off
####Actual result:
The gif auto plays despite gif auto play being turned off
####Client settings:
Discord Stable 2.5.0
####System settings:
iPhone 8 iOS 12.2 Beta 6

### As an extension I noticed this also happens starting from the recent mentions as well as from pinned messages, basically everywhere you can get that small history of chat around a message.
