Still an issue for me. iPhone 6s with iOS 11.0.3 & iPad Air 2 with iOS 11.1 PB 5, TestFlight 1.9.3 (1336). Might be easier to reproduce with older devices.

### This is intentionally destructive behavior. Again, I'm told there are people who get this all the time and it's not even time sensitive. I am not one of those people. The only crash that I can replicate with this is extremely strict timing that no user would ever reasonably do. - Jared on 2017-11-06T22:17:47.055Z
