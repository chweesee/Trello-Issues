Canrepro, as I found out the hard way, you do indeed have to go to the user that has left your servers profile from a mention, in this case a join message from dyno, otherwise you wonâ€™t crash. iPhone XR, iOS 12.1, TestFlight 3.1.2 (17140)

### Cannot reproduce anymore as of TestFlight 3.1.2 (17237) with iPad Pro (11-inch) running iOS 12.4.1.

I still sometimes get the option to manage the user and see a blank page when managing them but that is a different issue and related to https://trello.com/c/pgEVfn1v.
