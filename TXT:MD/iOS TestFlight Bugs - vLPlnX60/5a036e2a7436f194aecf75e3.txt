### Apparently, this bug is back... sort of? It appears that the emotes are not loading half of the time, but they are taking much more longer to load as of today. I am not the only one with this issue. iPhone 8 +, iOS 11.2.5 (Beta 2), Discord TestFlight 2.2.0 (1910), OTA 1982

Ghoul#4567 - Bug Bot on 2017-12-26T06:31:23.213Z


### Can reproduce.
iPhone 6, iOS 11.1.2, TestFlight 2.2.0 (build 1982), the bug seems to have resurfaced and doesn‚Äôt seem to happen EVERY time. Either a message is required to be sent by another user below it for the emoji to load, or switching to another channel and returning to the previous channel is required for the emoji to load and appear.

### I can't reproduce this 100% of the times anymore, some of the emojis fail to render while other don't.
