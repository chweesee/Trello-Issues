### Based onto the steps provided by QwakGoesDuck#0420, I was able to reproduce this bug on iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 Dev Beta 2 with Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). As I scroll up quickly, a few random messages will automatically highlight as they are not even the found message. 

Because I was able to reproduce this bug, I have edited the reproduction steps and will be moving this ticket to User Reported Bugs for verification.  - Ghoul on 2018-07-02T21:12:28.358Z
