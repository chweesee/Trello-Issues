####Steps to reproduce:
- Click the channel name 
- Click notification settings

####Actual result:
The button is clickable, but when you click it nothing happens because this is your original settings

### if you turn on 'mute channel', it won't give you an option to reset settings. the same goes for if you change mentions to all messages **and** turn on mute channel, when you click reset settings, it will only reset mentions and not mute channel toggle.

### I think in this instance it just means "discord all changes", which it technically does. Even if this is technically a bug, it's so minor it's not worth fixing. - Jared on 2017-09-18T22:42:28.040Z
