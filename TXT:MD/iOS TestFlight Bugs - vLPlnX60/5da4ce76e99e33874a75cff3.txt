This report may be valid for 4-inch specific devices, but I believe more options can get cut off depending on the height of the device. For example look here: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/420995378582913030/648222292203143168/image0.png, the button got sort of cut off and bye-bye text, so I believe this can impact any device, as long as there's more buttons than there is to show for that device. iPhone 7: iOS 13.2.3; TestFlight 3.1.7 (18209)

### This now affects Copy Message Link, Copy ID and the Report option for 4 inch devices. - Daffyduck on 2020-01-29T00:14:38.572Z


### Extension: YouTube is hidden in the "Add New Connection" action sheet. - Daffyduck on 2020-02-21T14:22:34.343Z
