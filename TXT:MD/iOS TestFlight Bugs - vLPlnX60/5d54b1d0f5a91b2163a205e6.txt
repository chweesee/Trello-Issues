Reported by username#6666

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go into a server with a voice channel that you have permission to view but do not have permission to connect to 
- Tap on the locked channel 
- Tap `Join Channel`

####Expected result:
Discord should display a message or just refuse the connection. The channel should appear as normal.
####Actual result:
Tapping "Join Channel" does nothing. When you exit, the channel name is lighter than others.
####Client settings:
iOS TestFlight 3.1.1 16898
####System settings:
iPhone 7, iOS 13.0
