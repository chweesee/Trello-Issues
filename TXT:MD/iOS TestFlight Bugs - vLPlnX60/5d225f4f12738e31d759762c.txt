####Steps to reproduce:
- Send a game/spotify invite from desktop 
- Load discord up on iOS and go to the channel where the invite was sent 
- Close discord on iOS 
- Make the game/spotify invite expire (closing the game/spotify should work) 
- After it has expired load up discord on iOS 
- Observe how iOS discord is now stuck in a crash loop (to fix this you must now reinstall the app)

####Expected result:
There is no crash loop
####Actual result:
There is a crash loop
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.0.5 (16102)
####System settings:
iPhone X, iOS 12.1; Windows 10 Home x64 (1809)
