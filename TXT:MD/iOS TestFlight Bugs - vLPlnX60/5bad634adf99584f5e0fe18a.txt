### I can't reproduce this bug with the exact reproduction steps presented as of TestFlight 2.4.3 (10936) on my iPhone 7 Plus running iOS 12.1.3; however, I found an extension of it that which I presume to be Plus/X iPhone models specific. The reproduction steps are the following:
- Send a message in a text channel
- Tap on channel name to open channel settings
- Set a new channel topic
