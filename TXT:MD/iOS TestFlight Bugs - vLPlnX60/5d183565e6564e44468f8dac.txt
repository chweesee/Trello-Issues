####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Discord 
- Go to a Discord Server that has a voice channel
- Make sure you are not an Admin and the permission "Use Voice Activity" is denied for you
- Join the voice channel 
- Try pressing okay after you get the suppress message 
- You should be able to see who is in the voice channel after the suppress message disappear

####Expected result:
Be able to press okay after joining the voice channel and then it should show the list on who is in the voice channel.
####Actual result:
Infinite load when pressing okay, unable to leave the voice channel. (Tried restarting, reinstalling, opening the app, closed the app, and tried waiting 10 minutes off the app or more which could possibly be the only resolution at the moment.)
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.0.5 (15973)
####System settings:
iPhone 5s, IOS 12.3.1

### Moving to Notable Issues since it causes a crash loop you cannot escape until you reinstall the app. - Pascal on 2019-06-30T14:16:15.165Z

### to get the crash loop you may have to delete the voice channel while someone is stuck with the prompt
