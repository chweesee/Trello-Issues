####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a channel where you have a large mention suggestion drawer 
- Type the "at" symbol and scroll down in the suggestion drawer 
- Delete and retype the "at" symbol and observe the position of the drawer 
- Note: this does not happen every time, so try at least 5 times, and with scrolling different amounts, if it doesn't happen the first time

####Expected result:
Suggestion drawer position resets to the top
####Actual result:
Suggestion drawer position resets halfway scrolled down the first suggestion
