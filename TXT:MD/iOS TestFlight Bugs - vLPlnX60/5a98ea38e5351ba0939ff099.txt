####Steps to reproduce:
- Send an message in a server. 
- Put iPad to sleep. 
- Wake it up to go back into Discord.

####Expected result:
You should see your text channel fully.
####Actual result:
There is a black space which acts like you dragged to see your channels and servers but nothing is there. It is also difficult to drag back, as if it's stuck.
####Client settings:

####System settings:
iPad 2017 Model (5th Generation), iOS 10.3.2

### I tested again with Discord TestFlight 2.2.5 (2894) and I was not able to reproduce my own bug, so I asked the BHs to push it for archival reasoning.
