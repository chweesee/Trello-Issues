####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a server and proceed to edit a channel. 
- In the channel topic field, type in any link, (Google's would be easiest) and add spoilers around the link. 
- Tap save, you are now stuck in a crash loop.

####Expected result:
You should be able to view the channel without crashing.
####Actual result:
You are stuck in a crash loop until you remove the spoilers around the link.
