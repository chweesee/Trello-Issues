### Verified on iPhone 8 + running iOS 12, Dev Beta 6 with DIscord TestFlight 2.3.6 (6427). I used a image that was falsely flagged to reproduce this bug, and the image upload bar only hits at least 25% before disappearing without any form of the error messages.

Moving this bug to Verified. - Ghoul on 2018-08-08T06:58:22.890Z

### **Extension**
There is also no error message when trying to upload an image to a user who blocked DMs. You should get the common Clyde message and best would be that the text does not disappear.

### This is actually a missing feature and not a bug according to Victoria.

Therefore moving to not a bug. - Pascal on 2019-05-24T21:23:47.779Z
