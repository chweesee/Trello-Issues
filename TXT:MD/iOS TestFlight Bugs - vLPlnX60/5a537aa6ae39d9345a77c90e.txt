####Steps to reproduce:
- Start by typing :, as if you are attempting to manually insert an emoji to text 
- Put in some text as if you are attempting to type an emoji, try to use actual words instead of spam or gibberish.
- After typing the words (or actually tapping an emoji from drop down menu), hold backspace

####Expected result:
All text will delete, including : command in beginning without stopping.
####Actual result:
Backspacing will stop short just at the first :, sometimes will stop mid emoji name or after the second : command. You would have to keep tapping backspace to delete everything.
####Client settings:
Test Flight 2.2.0 (2080)
####System settings:
iPhone 8, iOS 11.1.2

### This bug is basically not fixable with the current implementation of our chat.

**However** we have a larger task planned in the future that will basically re-do how we render our chat list.  Thus this is technically being fixed but not until that gets done. - Miguel Gaeta on 2018-03-17T00:15:21.832Z
