- Enable the new Discord share extension 
- Go to Safari for example and open any website 
- Click on the share icon 
- Select Discord 
- Observe the sorting of the servers for `Share in` and the channels of the servers in `Share to`

They should be sorted like in the Discord app.

They seem to be sorted randomly.
