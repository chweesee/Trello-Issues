### Please ignore the previous movement. I apparently misread this ticket as something else. I will move it back. 

On the actual issue. I can no longer reproduce this ticket on iPhone 8 +, running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2) with Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5425). The text is no longer hidden by the cursor.  - Ghoul on 2018-06-26T19:57:16.590Z
