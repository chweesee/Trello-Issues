####Steps to reproduce:
- Open discord and press home button/ minimise the app 
- Open a game or app which doesn’t support split screen(this bug is iPad only) 
- Drag discord so it comes in a side, taking up a little part of the screem 
- Now open discord again, this time in full screen

####Expected result:
It should be normal
####Actual result:
There’s a strange space below the send messages menu. It stays that way until we close and restart discord
####Client settings:
Stable 3.1.9
####System settings:
iPad OS 13.2, iPad Pro 10.5”
