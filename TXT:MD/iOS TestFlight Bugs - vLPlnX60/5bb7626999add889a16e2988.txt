####Steps to reproduce:
- mention someone 
- move cursor to space before the @ 
- start typing

####Expected result:
Typing would trigger no response from the app, and text would appear as it does when typing any message
####Actual result:
Text triggers the suggested mentions menu as if there was @ preceding it, selected letters dont work, shift is selected
####Client settings:
iOS Testflight 2.3.9 (8023)
####System settings:
iPhone 7, iOS 12.0
