Reported by enamored#1222

####Steps to reproduce:
- start a private call  
- find someone who is streaming in a public channel  
- click the stream but select cancel rather than joining  
- observe the green call banner

####Expected result:
it should cancel as usual and the banner should display who you’re in call with.
####Actual result:
after selecting cancel it says you’re in the users steam along with the user you’re in a prive call with. after selecting the voice channel that the user is streaming in a second time it says the stream has failed to start.
