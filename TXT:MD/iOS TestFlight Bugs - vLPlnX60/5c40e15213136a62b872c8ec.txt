####Steps to reproduce:
- Get the "Something's Going on Here" screen (you can get it easily by creating a new account with a temporary email like tempmail) 
- Tap on "Verify by Phone" and subsequently on "Back" to observe the buggy animations

####Expected result:
The elements of the "Something's Going on Here" screen shouldn't shift up/down during and after the animations.
####Actual result:
The elements of the screen move up/downwards during and after the animation, making it look inconsistent and wonky.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.4.2 (10573) & Stable 2.4.1 (tested on both)
####System settings:
iPhone 7 Plus with iOS 12.1.2
