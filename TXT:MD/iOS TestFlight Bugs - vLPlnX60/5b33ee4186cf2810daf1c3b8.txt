### I can no longer reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5548). The Send button is disabled, so I can't really send any spaces. I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Developer Beta 2).

Because I was not able to reproduce this bug anymore, I am moving it to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-06-30T05:33:56.406Z

### Can reproduce again as of TestFlight 3.0.2 (14873) with iPhone 8 Plus running iOS 12.2.

The issue now only happens when typing a space, then a letter and clicking the send and remove button nearly at the same time. Edited the steps to include the new issue.

Moving to Reopened list. - Pascal on 2019-05-13T06:42:33.085Z
