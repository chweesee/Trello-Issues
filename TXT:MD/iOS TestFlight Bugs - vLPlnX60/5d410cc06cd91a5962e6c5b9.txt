####Steps to reproduce:
- Write a message like this `- random321 > random123`. 
- Add a newline (press enter) after you've written it and send the message. 
- Observe.

####Expected result:
Part of the message shouldn't be quote at all.
####Actual result:
The part after `>` is quoted for a split second and when it goes back to normal it will leave the message with a box bigger than the usual.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.0.8 (16488)
####System settings:
iPhone XS, iOS 13 (Developer Beta 5)
