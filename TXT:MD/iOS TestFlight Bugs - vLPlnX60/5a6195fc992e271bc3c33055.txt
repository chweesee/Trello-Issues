####Steps to reproduce:
- Post an image link that has an image preview in an embed (i.e Imgur) (This step is optional) 
- Go to the "Jump to Chat" page where the image in embed preview is seen (you can either use search or the pin messages) (Important: Use `in: <The channel that you're in>` in the search tab to make to make sure that the "Jump to Chat" screen is in the same channel as you are or you won't be able to open the image preview when you're on a different channel) 
- Tap on the image 
- Close the image by swiping it down

####Expected result:
The image should be closed without crashing
####Actual result:
The app crashes
####Client settings:
Discord Stable 2.2.0
####System settings:
iPad (4th generation), iOS 10.3.3

### Pascal helped me to test this bug with iPhone 8 +, running iOS 12.1.4 (iOS TestFlight 2.4.5(1113). This ticket was not able to be reproduced but he commented that he was no longer able to open the image preview by tapping on it, so checking up about this ticket.  - Ghoul on 2019-02-16T20:30:16.617Z
