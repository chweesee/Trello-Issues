### I can no longer reproduce as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560) on iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2). The white images goes smoothly under my keyboard, and did not disappear instantly as it went below the message input box but continued to move down smoothly until it was gone from the view. 

Becuase I am unable to reproduce this bug anymore, I am moving it to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-03T01:18:30.041Z
