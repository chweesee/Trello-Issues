### This ticket is an extension of https://trello.com/c/rLWJVKEo/282-voice-channel-name-stays-white-when-you-rejoin-a-server-if-youre-in-the-channel-when-you-leave as it has the same end result (The channel name being more bold as if it's highlighted) but it has different reproduction steps while I was checking it for the event submission.

Because of this ticket being an extension, I am going to archive it. - Ghoul on 2018-07-07T01:40:14.008Z
