####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure you are not an Admin but you have Manage Roles permission 
- Long hold any channel and edit it 
- Go to permissions and add one of your own roles as a permission override 
- Try to deny any of the permissions for your role for this channel which will also deny it for you

####Expected result:
You should see the warning message that you cannot deny the permission for this role.
####Actual result:
When trying to deny the permission for your role, it will be granted instead.
