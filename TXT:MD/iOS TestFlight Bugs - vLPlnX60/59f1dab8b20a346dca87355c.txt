### Cannot reproduce. I'm actually seeing the Sync Clients option as being broken, changing it on desktop isn't reflecting on mobile at all and vice versa. - Jared on 2017-10-26T19:59:32.919Z

### I am still able to reproduce, I have slightly different reproduction steps though: 

- Open the Discord iOS app as well as the desktop version of Discord
- Switch themes on desktop 

​Discord 1.9.3 (1340), iOS 11.0.3, iPhone 8 Plus

### I can no longer reproduce, changing the theme on desktop doesn’t crash the iOS app anymore.
