This is referring to the time/battery info/etc on the very top. - Jared on 2016-12-19T23:46:23.653Z

### Can reproduce.
Still an issue for me like in the picture above. iPhone 6s with iOS 11.0.3 & iPad Air 2 with iOS 11.1 PB 5, TestFlight 1.9.3 (1336)

### Can reproduce.
Only with dark theme though (if it happens on white theme, it's most likely a rare iOS bug). Black theme has white status bar text, and the image selector is a white panel, so it'll be white text on a white panel. iPhone 8 Plus, iOS 11.1 (PB5), Discord TestFlight 1.9.3 (1336)

### ​I can reproduce this 100% of the times when using the dark theme.

### Extension to this issue: 
- Go to User Settings
- Click on your profile picture
You will see the camera roll to pop up, where you can see that the top status is even worse in reading.

I tested on iPhone 8 + running iOS 12, Dev Beta 6 with Discord TestFlight 2.3.6 (6755). It's an extension because of the different reproduction steps, but same end result. - Ghoul on 2018-08-14T07:38:28.776Z
