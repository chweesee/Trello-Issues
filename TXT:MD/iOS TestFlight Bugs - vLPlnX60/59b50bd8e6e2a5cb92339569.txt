Reported by Pascal#0929

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open server settings 
- Go to member list 
- Click on any member with very long user name 
- Observe the kick button 
- Make sure you are using an iPhone (not happens with iPad)

####Expected result:
User name should be completely shown and not be cut off
####Actual result:
User name is cut off in the second line of the kick button. Best solution would be to shorten very long user names.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 1.9.1
####System settings:
iPhone 6S, iOS 10.3.3
