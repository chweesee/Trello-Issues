####Steps to reproduce:
- Open a DM with someone who has an animated emote custom status. 
- Switch DM's with someone who has a custom status with someone who has an external emote which isn't animated. 
- Keep switching DM's several times, you will see the emote doesn't change, and animated emote replaces the other user's non-animated emote.

####Expected result:
The emote should change.
####Actual result:
The animated emote is there instead of the non-animated one the user has. It doesn't change.
####Client settings:
Testflight 20.0 (19727)
####System settings:
iPhone 7 13.3.1
