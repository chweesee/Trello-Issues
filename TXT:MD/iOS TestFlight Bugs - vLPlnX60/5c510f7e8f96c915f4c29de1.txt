####Steps to reproduce:
- View "Invite Members" page 
- Spam "Invite" on a particular user 
- Observe how the button eventually changes to "Sent" 
- View PMs to that user, observe how several invites were sent (depending on how many times you hit the invite button before it changed.)

####Expected result:
Any button presses after the initial press should not be registered.
####Actual result:
Several invites are sent spamming user's DMs.
