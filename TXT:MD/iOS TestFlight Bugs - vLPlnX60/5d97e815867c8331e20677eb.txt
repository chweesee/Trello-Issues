####Steps to reproduce:
- Type someoneâ€™s tag in a channel 
- Type a few words and then select some text 
- Drag the beginning of the selection highlight to the left of the @ symbol 
- Drag the end of the selection highlight to left of the @ symbol 
- By clicking, move your cursor to anywhere in the middle of the text 
- By clicking, move your cursor to the end of the message field and type

####Expected result:
Moving both ends of the selection highlight to before the @ symbol should revert it to a normal cursor (as nothing is selected)
####Actual result:
The selection highlight remains, with nothing highlighted and gets stuck, following you to other channels. Clicking the end of the text will just stop the cursor from displaying. This persists until restart or until you stretch the selection highlight out again and dismiss it by tapping in the message field
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.4 (17575)
####System settings:
iPhone XR iOS 13.1.2
