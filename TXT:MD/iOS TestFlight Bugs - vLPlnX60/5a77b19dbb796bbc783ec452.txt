Reported by Pascal#0929

####Steps to reproduce:
- Change your language to any Non-English language like German 
- Go to any server 
- Open the search 
- Select any date filter like `before`
- Workaround to open the date picker: Click the backspace key, click the space key and then he backspace key again 
- Observe the strings there

####Expected result:
Strings should be translated to the specific language. Best solution would be to use the iPhone date picker.
####Actual result:
Always the English strings are used.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.2.2 (2352)
####System settings:
iPad Air 2, iOS 11.3 PB 1
