### I checked this bug for the Trello Cleaning event, and I was still able to reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5589). The application still does as described in the video, having some black space before fixing itself.

I used iPad 2017 Model (5th Generation) running iOS 11.2.6. I will leave this ticket to be. - Ghoul on 2018-07-03T03:10:01.795Z
