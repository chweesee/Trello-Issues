Reported by Pascal#0929

####Steps to reproduce:

- Write any message which contains a user mention at the beginning (mentioning yourself doesn't work) 
- Delete this message, pin it or something else that causes a confirmation message 
- Click on the mention in the confirmation pop-up

####Expected result:
The mention shouldn't be clickable (like Desktop client) and doesn't link to the user
####Actual result:
You can click on this mention and the user profile opens. Also the confirmation message still persists but doesn't work anymore
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.2.0 (2121)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s, iOS 11.2.2 & iPad Air 2, iOS 11.2.5 Public Beta 5
