####Steps to reproduce:
- Change the username of an alt account to `ùì£ùìÆùìºùìΩ` 
- Give your alt account any nickname on any server you share with your alt, e.g. `Test` 
- Go back to your main account and try to mention your alt account by typing `@<Their Nickname except the last letter>` (e.g. `@Tes` when their nickname is `Test`) 
- Select the suggestion for your alt account that appears in the autocomplete mention list

####Expected result:
The app shouldn't crash.
####Actual result:
The app crashes and you cannot mention the user.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.4.5 (11113)
