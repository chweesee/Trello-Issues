####Steps to reproduce:
- Be in the unofficial hypesquad balance server so u have their emotes 

- Create a server or have an existing one 

- Go to your chatbox and type `:dontfeelsobalanced:` 

- Observe how it looks odd in the emote preview, but does look normal when pasting in chat.

####Expected result:

####Actual result:
The gif emote has a static png and doesn’t disappear properly
