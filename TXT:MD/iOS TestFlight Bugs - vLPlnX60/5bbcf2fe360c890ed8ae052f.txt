####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a server where you can kick/ban members 
- Open the kick/ban page 
- Tap on the reason field 
- Observe the typing cursor right as you tap on the field 
- If you don't notice anything, close the page and try again 
- Note: This happens immediately after tapping the field, so you have to be watching the field closely before and as you tap on it

####Expected result:
Typing cursor doesn't resize
####Actual result:
Typing cursor starts off small for a split second and then resizes to the proper size
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.3.9 (8055)
####System settings:
