####Steps to reproduce:
- Note: You can't post the link and try to search it since it would be in your cache. Try looking for an old message with the invite link. BUT, once you see the invite link, it gets cached, so you have to restart your app to clear it. 
- First, try searching something like "invite link"  
- Tap some message that's not an actual invite link. (Jumping directly to the invite link works) 
- If there's an invite link around that message, it will crash.

####Expected result:
Jumps without crashing
####Actual result:
App crashes
####Client settings:
TF 2.3.2 (4528)
####System settings:
iPhone X 11.1.2

### Verified.

Slightly easier repro steps:
- On PC, post a message with any content that's easily searchable
- Post a valid invite link to any server.
- On your iOS Device, relaunch the app.
- Search for the specific message from step 1
- Tap on the result to progress to the "Jump to Chat" screen
