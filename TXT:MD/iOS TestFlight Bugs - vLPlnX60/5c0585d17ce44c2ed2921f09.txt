### **Extension to this issue**
The comment for an image also disappears when your image/file is too big to upload and you are trying to send it.

### **Another extension**
If images fail to upload silently (e.g. the user has blocked you, doesnâ€˜t share any mutual servers or the explicit content filter blocked your image), the text also disappears. - Pascal on 2019-07-04T18:42:48.316Z
