####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to any guild (where you are admin) 
- Tap and hold on any channel 
- When the actions menu appears, keep holding your finger 
- Move your finger up and down, and see how the channel list is scrolling in the background 
- Now, go into a text channel 
- Tap and hold on a message 
- When the actions menu appears, keep holding your finger 
- Move your finger up and down, and notice that you are not scrolling in the text channel in the background

####Expected result:
When an action menu appears, scrolling should be disabled, or AT LEAST be consistant thoughout text channels and channel lists
####Actual result:
The text channel and the channel list have different behaviours

### This bug cannot be reproduced on Android and thus the android approval can be ignored. I asked some bug hunters and an Trello Admin (Tarek) to verify if they could. But they couldnâ€™t. This bug seem to happen on iOS devices only so far.
