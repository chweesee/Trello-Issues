####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a server and prepare a message that you want to be in bold, or have underlined, etc. 
- Use the spoiler tag symbols before and after your text as you would normally, but then also add markdown (bold, underline, whatever you feel) before and after the spoiler tags. 
- It will only be a spoiler; does not include the other formats unless done within the spoiler tag symbols.

####Expected result:
Should not matter which order your text formatting is in.
####Actual result:
It will not make your spoiler text bold, underlined, etc. if you have the other formatting symbols outside of spoiler.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.4.2 (10773)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s Plus, iOS 12.1.2

### Can reproduce.
CR, iPhone 6s Plus, iOS 12.1.2, TestFlight 2.4.3 (10846) - you can now bolden and italicise text outside of spoiler tags, but other markdown formats (e.g. bold italics, underline, and strikethrough) do not work when outside of spoiler tags.

Still happens with Strikethrough and Underlined text, other Markdown formatting is shown - keep in mind that multiple Markdown (e.g. bold and italic is a different bug https://trello.com/c/FbeX8F4z) - iPhone 8 Plus, iOS 12.1.3 - TestFlight 2.4.3 (10846)
