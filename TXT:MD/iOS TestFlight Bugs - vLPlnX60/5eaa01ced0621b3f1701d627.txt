The team is looking for consistent repro's for an issue we have been observing on iOS where after connecting to a voice channel/go live stream and backgrounding the application - the app crashes/disconnect you from the channel without user action.

We suspect it might have something to do with the app losing connectivity while backgrounded.

Similar reports but we cannot find a consistent repro:

### Can reproduce.
Short Description: When an alarm/timer goes off when your phone is locked (not off) while listening to music, hitting stop for the timer exits you out of the call.
Steps to reproduce
1. join a vc
2. play some music that will continue to play in the background when your screen is off (like spotify)
3.start a timer (15 seconds is what i did)
4. hit the power button (dont turn it off)
5. when the timer is done, hit stop
6. observe
Expected Result: you should stay in the call
Actual Result: You get kicked out after hitting stop
Client Settings: 20.0 (19727)
System Settings: Iphone XR, iOS 13.3.1

Note: This does not appear to be callkit specific
