####Steps to reproduce:
- Go into server settings, roles 
- Click add a role then go back to the role list 
- Notice how the new role seams to be missing 
- Leave roles list then re-enter and notice the role is now there 
- Click modify and try to delete the role you just created 
- Notice how it does not disappear and you can try deleting it multiple times 
- Leave role list and enter again, notice the role has disappeared now

####Expected result:
As soon as you create a role or delete it, the list should update as it did in 3.1.10
####Actual result:
The list does not update unless you quit and re-enter role menu
