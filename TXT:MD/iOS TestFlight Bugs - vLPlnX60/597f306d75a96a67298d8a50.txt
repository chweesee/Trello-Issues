####Steps to reproduce:
- Get a alt, and get it to call your main/other account 
- Answer the call on your main/other account 
- Disconnect the alt account, and you will see a text saying “<Your alt name> started a call. Join the Call”
- click “Join the Call”

####Expected result:
The alt or account will join right back in to the call (if the call is still active)
####Actual result:
Nothing
