[Archived] When typing @ or beginning to mention everyone/here in an empty server, the app will either crash or extremely glitch out forcing you to restart, or will crash in other places as a result. (https://trello.com/c/KYeyis5l)

Reported by JustGamer#2542, originally found by: Inkydink#9098

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a brand new channel (do not post any messages in it). 
- Open the keyboard and type "@"; this should bring up an empty grey mention suggestion box that may result in the app crashing. 
- If it does not crash, continue typing a couple more characters next to the @ such as every, until the grey rectangle goes down to the regular everyone suggestion size. 
- The app should now begin to lag/slow down the key presses as you continue typing. 
- Swiping to the channel list/member list causes the channels or members to appear in an odd way and then constantly flash around for a second or two. 
- When receiving messages in a channel the message will jump around in a very unintended way, not seen before. 
- More of the side effects of this bug can be read in 7938 reported by Ghoul.

####Expected result:
The mentions list should load fine when inputting @, as well as load the everyone suggestion fine instead of creating a grey box and crashing/lagging the app.
####Actual result:
The application either crashes upon the first @ or severely slows down with multiple problems and then crashes when pressing to open the Server Settings dropdown in a guild. (Iâ€™m sure there are a couple other ways of making it crash as a side effect to this bug).
####Client settings:
Discord TestFlight 2.2.1 (build 2202)
####System settings:
iPhone 6, iOS 11.1
