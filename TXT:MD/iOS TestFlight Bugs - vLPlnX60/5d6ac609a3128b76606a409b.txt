####Steps to reproduce:
- Enable iOS VoiceOver 
- Navigate to anywhere you can upload an image & double tap to open the image picker UI 
- Swipe right to navigate through the options 
- Swipe left to go back through them

####Expected result:
The View All and Camera button should be selected and read when you scroll by them
####Actual result:
Swiping right skips the buttons entirely, swiping left will select it in addition to the photo below and just read “button” double tapping this element just selects the photo to be sent and ignores the button. There is no indication the buttons exist while scrolling.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.2 (17133)
####System settings:
iPhone XR iOS 12.4
