Reported by binchlord#0998

####Steps to reproduce:
- Enable iOS VoiceOver 
- Navigate to search and enter a term that will trigger the calendar 
- Pick a date and swipe 
- Pick the month and swipe

####Expected result:
Swiping on the dates should read the next or previous date as swiping on the days of the week does. Swiping on the months should navigate to the next or previous month
####Actual result:
Swiping while a date/month is selected does nothing and VoiceOver indicates that there are no other selectable items on the page, there is no way to change which month is selected besides manually clicking it
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.9 (18591)
####System settings:
iPhone XR iOS 13.3
