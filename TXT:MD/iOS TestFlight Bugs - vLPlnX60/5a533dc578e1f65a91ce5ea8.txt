####Steps to reproduce:
- Get 2 accounts. 1st one to revoke talk perms,  can be any platform. The second to talk, iOS for this one.  
- Use the second account to type (NOT POST, JUST TYPE) in a channel.  
- Get account 1 to revoke talk perms of account 2. 
- Notice how on the second account, on iOS, the text you typed cannot be removed,  even after reboot it will still be there.

####Expected result:
(account 2) Text in typebox is removed.
####Actual result:
Text will forever stay there until account 2 gets their perms back to remove the text in it. Even after reboot this text remains.
####Client settings:

####System settings:
