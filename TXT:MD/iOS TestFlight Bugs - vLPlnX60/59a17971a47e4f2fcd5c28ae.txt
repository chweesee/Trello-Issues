### This isn't a bug, the same thing happens on desktop. - Jared on 2017-09-18T23:10:12.746Z

### This behaviour didn't use to happen (can't remember what build), and it also didn't happen on any other version, until it randomly changed to not resolve. I guess maybe it needs to be a feature request to restore this behaviour, rather than a bug report?

### Dabbit, this does NOT happen on Desktop at all, thus this is a bug that needs to be fixed. I just asked someone to post a channel link on the BHT server and on desktop, the notification showed the textual name, not the Snowflake ID.
