### **Extension to this issue**
- Write or edit a long a message
- Select the beginning or the middle of the message 
- Add a mention or channel link (make sure the dropdown list for selecting this appears)

Chat scrolls now to the ending of the message or the text field gets blank.

### I can no longer reproduce on Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). The message stays in its current position even after doing an Enter or including the channel mention / user mention. I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 Dev Beta 2.

Because I am unable to reproduce, I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-02T21:28:46.918Z
