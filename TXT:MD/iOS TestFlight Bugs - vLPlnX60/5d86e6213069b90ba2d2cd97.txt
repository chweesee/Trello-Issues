[Archived] Selecting elements in the user settings menu will not leave them selected, and will immediately and automatically jump to the friends list icon behind the menu, sometimes even jumping fast enough to prevent VO from reading the thing you selected, and then get stuck in a loop of reading the friends list icon information (https://trello.com/c/d4erF8F0)

Reported by binchlord#0998

####Steps to reproduce:
- Enable iOS VoiceOver 
- Open user/channel/dm/discord settings 
- Click on any setting

####Expected result:
The setting should be read and remain selected so that double tapping activates it
####Actual result:
A different button that you can’t see and can’t select is immediately selected and read, sometimes interrupting VoiceOver from reading what you’ve selected, and then VoiceOver will get stuck in a loop of reading the icon information and cutting itself off as it’s constantly reselected
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.3 (17389)
####System settings:
iPhone XR iOS 13.0
