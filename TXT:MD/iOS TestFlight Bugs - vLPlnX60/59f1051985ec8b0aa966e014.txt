### I was unable to reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). When I type in the hash symbol, nothing really shows up as if my DMs was a server of some sort as I don't see any form of options. I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2).

Because I was not able to reproduce this bug, I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-02T17:26:08.612Z
