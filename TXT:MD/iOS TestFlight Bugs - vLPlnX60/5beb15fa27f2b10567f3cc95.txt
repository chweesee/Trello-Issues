### Can reproduce.
iPhone 7 iOS 12.0 TestFlight Build 2.4.0 (8921) - This might take a couple of tries, it requires a user that has a username or nickname in Japanese. Also, converting the first hiragana to katakana is not possible if there's an '@' before it, so for example you can't mention a user that has a katakana username or nickname.
