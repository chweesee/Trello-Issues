Reported by MrJWOfficial#9776

####Steps to reproduce:
- Pin a message from Discord System. (I don’t even think you are supposed to do that cause there is no pin menu) 
- It will pop up with the pin message. You can even delete the pin message.

####Expected result:
It won’t pop up with the pin message. (You won’t be able to pin message from Discord System cause there is no pin menu)
####Actual result:
It popped up with the ping menu. You can even delete it.
####Client settings:
30.0
####System settings:
