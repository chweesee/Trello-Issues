### Extension to this is that it also happens with channel #‚Äôs. So if you post a long message with a channel # in it, it will copy the whole message instead of channel # ID

### This level of granularity is outside of the scope of the feature as it stands today.

We don't currently support subtext long press actions at all in the chat.  Thats why when you long press on the mention/channel it just shows the same long press menu over all.

Maybe someday but developer mode is already a niche feature so I only added the most common paths. - Miguel Gaeta on 2018-10-04T23:56:01.738Z
