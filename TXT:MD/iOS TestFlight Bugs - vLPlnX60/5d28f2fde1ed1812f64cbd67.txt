Reported by Calvandos ~DST#6666

####Steps to reproduce:

- Create a voice channel 
- Deny the permission for everyone to *Speak*
- Join the voice channel with an alt account that doesn’t have admin permissions and gets server muted in this voice channel
- With your main account open the Voice Channel and Click on the profile of the alt account
- Observe the server mute status in the mini profile

####Expected result:
The server mute toggle in the mini profile should show the correct status.
####Actual result:
The alt account is shown as not server muted even though they are. You have to server mute and server unmute to show the correct status.
####Client settings:
Stable 3.0.5
####System settings:
iPhone 7

### Cannot reproduce as of TestFlight 3.0.6 (16208) with iPad Pro (11 inch) running iOS 12.4.

The server mute change is always shown instantly for me.

Also **please make sure** to use a proper title, in general a more descriptive report and valid client and system settings in the future, the report is very unclear. I had to edit the whole report.
