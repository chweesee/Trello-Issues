### As noted by CustomName, as this is the incorrect screen, it has the side effect  of not being able to end a call. - Mike Nisbet on 2018-06-22T00:46:43.469Z


### Because of this ticket seeming to be related to the chat rewrite, I am moving this ticket to the Chat Rewrite list. - Ghoul on 2018-06-22T03:12:31.667Z

### I can no longer reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5548). I can now hang up in the calls that I am in without any issues. I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Developer Beta 2).

Because I was unable to reproduce this bug anymore, I am moving it to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-06-30T02:45:06.155Z
