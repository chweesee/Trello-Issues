####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a PC with discord 
- Have an iOS device with discord 
- Have someone join your server or join a server with welcome messages enabled 
- Give the new person a nickname 
- Restart both clients 
- Observe the welcome message 
- Note: I am aware of the trello link [rth9mwjz] but it is "Archived" and "Fixed"

####Expected result:
Both clients show the same message
####Actual result:
The PC shows the username while the iOS device shows the nickname

####System settings:
