Reported by HyperKids#4976

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to iOS settings and set the “t” key to autocorrect to “HAPPY 10000 BUG REPORTS 🎉🎉🎉” (or in reality, any string) 
- Test to make sure it works (meaning, typing "t" should output your string) 
- Go into a Discord text channel 
- Type :r

####Expected result:
It should be :r
####Actual result:
The hitbox of the autocorrect bar drops as the emoji picker pops up, so you hit the autocorrect word as the hitbox drops, creating :HAPPY 10000 BUG REPORTS 🎉🎉🎉
####Client settings:
Discord TestFlight 2.2.7, Build 3519
####System settings:
iPhone 6S, iOS 11.2.6

iPhone 6s Plus, iOS 11.2.6. TestFlight 2.2.7 (3519) | this is kinda weird, because usually autocorrect asks to correct first. [Can Repro]
