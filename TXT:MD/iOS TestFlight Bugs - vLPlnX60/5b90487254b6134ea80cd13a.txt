####Steps to reproduce:
- Type a message, the length doesn't matter 
- Lock your phone right before pressing the send button, and make sure the message hasn't left the text box when your phone locks 
- Unlock your phone and observe the position of the typing indicator 
- Note: this does not happen every time, try at least 10 times 
- Alternatively, lock and unlock your phone before the second step

####Expected result:
Typing indicator is at the beginning of the text box
####Actual result:
Typing indicator is "stuck" in the position where the last message ended
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.3.7 (6968)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s iOS 12 Dev Beta 12
