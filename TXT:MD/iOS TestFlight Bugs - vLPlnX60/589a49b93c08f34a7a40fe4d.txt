### I can no longer reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). Nothing really happens when I try to double click on the send message area more than once. I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2). 

Because I was not able to reproduce this bug anymore, I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-02T19:51:53.647Z
