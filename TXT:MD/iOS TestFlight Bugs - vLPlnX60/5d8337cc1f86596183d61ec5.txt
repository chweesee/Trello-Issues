### Can reproduce.
iPhone 8, iOS 13.1 (Dev Beta 3), TestFlight 3.1.3 (17341) - The flashing happens a few time on certain icons for my 8 but Discord Testers icon was the easiest for me to do it on (for it) when I went to the server and then closed and open the app (so it opens there). I tested this on my iPhone 5s running 12.4.1 TestFlight 3.1.3 (17389) and I was able to reproduce it better there. It could vary on phone speed and maybe performance.
