### Moved from New Issues to iPhone X Safe Area by Fanghao on 2018-10-09T21:51:22.834Z


### We are using now a new master ticket here https://trello.com/c/xebJZtcZ for all home indicator issues with iPad Pro and iPhone X/XS/XR/XS Max.

All issues will be transferred to the checklist there. Since this ticket is no longer needed then, I'm moving it back to New Issues and archiving. - Pascal on 2019-04-05T12:10:58.811Z
