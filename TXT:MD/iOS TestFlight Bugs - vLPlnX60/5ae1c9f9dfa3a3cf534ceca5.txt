### I can no longer reproduce as of iPhone 8 +, running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2) with Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). The keyboard is already down as soon that I get back to the channel, and I can see the message bar just fine.

Because I was not able to reproduce this bug anymore, I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-02T23:59:19.252Z

### Can reproduce again as of TestFlight 2.5.2 (13014) with iPad Pro (11 inch) running iOS 12.2. The issue slightly changed, now the keyboard will only overlap with the linked accounts in the user profile.
