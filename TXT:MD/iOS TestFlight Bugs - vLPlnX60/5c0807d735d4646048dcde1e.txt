####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure you're on a status that receives in-app notifications 
- Have someone send you a DM with backtick markdown 
- Observe the text in the in-app notification

####Expected result:
Backtick markdown shows the full formatting
####Actual result:
Backtick markdown only shows the formatted text, causing nearly invisible text on light theme
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.4.0 (9595)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s iOS 12.1.1 Dev Beta 3
