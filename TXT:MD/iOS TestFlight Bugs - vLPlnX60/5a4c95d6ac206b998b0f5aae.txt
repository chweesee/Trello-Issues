Reported by Ghoul#4567

####Steps to reproduce:

- Retrieve the link that has (png, jpeg, or any image related in the end.)  
- Paste it anywhere on your Discord (DMs, Test server, etc.) 
- Observe.

####Expected result:
Image preview shows just fine (See the screenshot from Build 1610)
####Actual result:
Depending on the link, if it's something like imgur then it just displays the embed but no preview. Other than that, you'd just see the link only, but no image preview at all.
####Client settings:
Discord TestFlight 2.2.0 (Build 2042)
####System settings:
iPhone 8 +, iOS 11.2.5 (Public Beta 2)
