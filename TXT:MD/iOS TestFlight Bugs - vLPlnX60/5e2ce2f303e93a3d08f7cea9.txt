####Steps to reproduce:
- generate a login QR code 
- scan the QR code via the app (scanning via the camera app will shortcut you to discord anyway) 
- notice the orientation is wrong 
- rotating to 'fix' the orientation will orientate the app and still have the wrong orientation

####Expected result:
the camera should have the same orientation as the app
####Actual result:
the camera has a 90 degree offset (not sure which direction)
####Client settings:
stable 3.1.9
####System settings:
ios 12.4.1, iPad 5
