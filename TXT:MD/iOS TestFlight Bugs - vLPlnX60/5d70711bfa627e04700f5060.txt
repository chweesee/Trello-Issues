####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Discord (Make sure you are on the latest TestFlight 17140 for this.) 
- Go to your Discord Settings and then go to Voice 
- Have Push to Talk as the Input Mode 
- Call someone in DM (An alt is fine as well.) 
- Observe the bottom of the VC when you call (where you'll see the ringing, voice connected when they enter the VC, the three dots, the arrows, and etc...) 
- Tap on the arrows that is facing a diagonal Southwest and Northeast on the top left 
- Observe the Push to Talk button in both in the call and out (but not ending the call like if you are in someone's DM, for example.) 
- Tap on Voice Connected on the top and observe (You may need to repeat Step 5 - 7 a few or a couple of times.)

####Expected result:
The Push to Talk button should appear in DM calls on the bottom where you have the video, mute, speaker (or Bluetooth), and the end call button.
####Actual result:
The Push to Talk button appears off the DM call and not in the DM call on the bottom where you have the video, mute, speaker (or Bluetooth), and the end call button.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.2 (17140)
####System settings:
iPhone 8, iOS 12.4
