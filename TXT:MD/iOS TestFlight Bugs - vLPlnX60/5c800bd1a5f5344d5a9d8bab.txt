####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure you're in a group DM with 6 people (I've only tested with below and at 6 people in group DMs) 
- Quit and reopen Discord

####Expected result:
It should load fine with no issues
####Actual result:
Discord usually goes into a crash loop and gives an error with the option to restart Discord that takes you back to the friends list
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.4.6 (11856)
####System settings:
iPhone X, iOS 12.2 (Dev Beta 4)
