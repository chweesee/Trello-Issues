####Steps to reproduce:
- Call someone, get called by someone, or enter a call. 
- Use two fingers to rapidly click the speaker and mute button as fast as you can, repeat for 10-15 seconds. 
- Stop clicking the buttons. (they should keep clicking themselves, like ghosts) 
- Observe. 
- If this doesn't work then keep spamming the buttons for longer. Time varies by device.

####Expected result:
The speaker and mute button should mute and unmute and turn on and off speaker mode for each time you press them.
####Actual result:
Instead, they backlog and freeze very often, causing there to be a delay and an eventual crash.
####Client settings:
Testflight 22.0 (19956) AND NonBeta Version 20.0
####System settings:
iPhone 8 // iOS 13.3.1 (took about 7 seconds of tapping.) AND iPhone 8 // iOS 13.4.1 (happened almost instantly) AND iPhone X // iOS 14.4.1 (took a bit longer)
