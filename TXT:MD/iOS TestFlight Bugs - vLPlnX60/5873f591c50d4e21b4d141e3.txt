### Not just group DM notifications, but also regular mentions as well.

### This is not something discord has any control over. We do not dictate whether things come over data or not.  If it's coming over data when you have the option disabled, it's because the notifications aren't coming from the discord app.  Push notifications come from Apple. - Jared on 2017-01-09T22:55:16.594Z
