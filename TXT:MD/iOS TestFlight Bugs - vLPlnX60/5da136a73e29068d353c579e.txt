### Can reproduce.
I can reproduce this simply without multitasking. Have Bluetooth off, and click "Start Nearby Scanning". Animation plays continuously and the errors will keep coming.

### On Tabs UI (which is the norm now) as I miraculously forgot to mention. Despite the [Old friends UI] on the short description, this can be done without now I guess? iPhone 7: iOS 13.2.3; TestFlight 3.1.9 (18456)

### Some more info found out recently. You need the Bluetooth option existent in iOS's settings app via Settings -> Discord. This makes it iOS 13+ specific, as only from this version onwards apps will ask for Bluetooth permission. It doesn't matter what this is set to, it just needs to exist in the first place. Your device's Bluetooth needs to be off, however. If you don't have the option in Settings -> Discord, you'll need Discord to prompt it in the first place ofc
