####Steps to reproduce:
- With your alt account or bot write a very long message with any kind of long embed (it should go off-screen) and send it in a channel with some message history 
- Be inactive for 1-2 hours (time is not exactly clear and might be not needed) with your main account (make sure the channel where you have posted with your alt is not opened) 
- Open the channel where the message was posted with your main account 
- If that didn’t cause the bug for you, don't scroll there, just press the home button and do the last 2 steps 
- Force close Discord via the app switcher 
- Reopen the channel and try it again

####Expected result:
Chat should keep position (at the beginning of the new unread message).
####Actual result:
It automatically scrolls back in message history. Note: This issue also happens without force closing the app and waiting a long time but haven't found steps for it so far. It might happen when the channel must completely reload and the embed loads after all the messages.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.4.5 (11113)
####System settings:
iPhone 8 Plus & iPad Pro 11" - iOS 12.1.4
