[Archived] When calling someone who is not in your friends list (such as a bot), the "need to be friends with x" popup appears, but the "Connect to Voice" menu appears behind it - popup should only appear on top of the DM channel. (https://trello.com/c/vCOJWPeS)

P3 - Will be fixed eventually,

####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a user that is not in your friends list (such as a bot). 
- Call this user. 
- When the popup appears, press "Okay" 
- Let the magic happen and the "Connect to Voice" menu with voice settings should appear. 
- May require one or two attempts, appears everytime for myself. 
- This may be inconsistency across devices but is a valid bug as of right now.

####Expected result:
The add friend to call popup should only appear on top of the DM chat not the connect menu.
####Actual result:
The popup appears with the connect menu behind it, pressing "Okay" keeps the menu until closing that as well.
####Client settings:
Discord TestFlight 2.2.0 (2121)
####System settings:
iPhone 6, iOS 11.1.2
