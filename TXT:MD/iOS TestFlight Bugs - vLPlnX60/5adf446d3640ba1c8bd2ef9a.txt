### I can no longer reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). The join server is now fixed to be sized properly even with the keyboard. The Join button is also no longer covering the server's name. I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2).

Because I was no longer able to reproduce this bug, I am moving it to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-02T20:42:54.656Z

### I can reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.6 (6095) on iPhone 8 + running iOS 12, Dev Beta 4 with the original reproduction steps. I can also reproduce this bug by following these reproduction steps provided by pre#0876:
- Go to any server, and open the keyboard layout by clicking on “Message #channel” 
- Close the discord app, without closing it entirely (so it runs in the background) 
- Open any browser, and type in a server invite in the url bar 
- Discord will automatically open the app, where it asks to join the server

I am moving it to Reopened. - Ghoul on 2018-08-01T01:02:54.161Z
