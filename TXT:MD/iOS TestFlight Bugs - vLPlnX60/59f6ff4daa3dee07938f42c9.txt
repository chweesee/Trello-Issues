####Steps to reproduce:
- With one account write at least 2 messages in any channel (make sure channel isn't muted for you) and delete all this sent messages 
- With other account go to this channel with the new messages that are just deleted messages 
- Switch to other channel in this server

####Expected result:
When opening the channel with the new messages, the channel should automatically be marked as read.
####Actual result:
When switching to other channel, the unread message indicator next to the channel name still persists. Only way to fix is to scroll to the bottom in this chat.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 1.9.3 (1340)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s with iOS 11.0.3 & iPad Air 2 with iOS 11.1 PB 5

### Can reproduce.
CR, make sure to enter the channel without scrolling (since if you touch the bottom that solves it) before going to the other channel (the unread should still stay there even though there's nothing to read and you were already on the bottom). Issue appeared on build 1336 and 1340, doesn't appear on 1286 or below (tested to 953). iPhone 8 Plus, iOS 11.1 (PB5), Discord TestFlight 1.9.3 (1336)
