### I checked this ticket since I was notified that it may be an extension of https://trello.com/c/ZvwjDT7e/804-textbox-does-not-collapse-after-keyboard-disappears but at this time, I am not fully convinced of whether this is an extension or not, though I'm not really sure myself. If someone could offer an explanation about how this is the same root cause, I'd greatly appreciate it.  - Ghoul on 2019-02-16T16:39:52.547Z
