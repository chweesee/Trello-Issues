####Steps to reproduce:
- Note, can reproduce in; user/server/notification/privacy settings, invite members, create dm, add friend, quick switcher, and recent mentions windows. Probably more as well but that's all I could think of.
- Have messages that go to the far right side of the chat window in landscape mode 
- Open any window that pops up on screen 
- Rotate the device

####Expected result:
The chat should not be displayed on the right side
####Actual result:
The chat is displayed on the right side
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.4.5 (11524)
####System settings:
iPad mini 3, iOS 12.1.4
