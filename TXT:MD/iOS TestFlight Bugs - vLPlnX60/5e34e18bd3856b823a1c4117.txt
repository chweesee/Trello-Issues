### Can reproduce.
CR: "Phone Mode" means that the music will continue playing but on the top "reciever" speaker. The volume does not change but output changes. You can test the output changing by going into Control Center and back to Discord, you will hear the output change. iPhone 8 Plus, iOS 13.3.1, TestFlight 3.1.10 (18928)

### Proper repro steps: 1. Make sure you have music playing in the background. 2. Open up User Settings > Voice and make sure you have Voice Activity. 3. Sound should be coming out of the earpiece instead of the speakers. (Also, this occasionally happens when watching a directly uploaded video through the embed.)
