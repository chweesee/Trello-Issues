### Can reproduce.
iPhone X, iOS 11.2.1, TestFlight 2.2.0 (1910) Do note that with the latest 1982 OTA, the issue does not occur but this may be a result of IPX fullscreen support being rolled back

### According to the iPhone X users, it seems to be sort of fixed, but iPhone X no longer has support. Told them to go ahead and push this bug to Trello so that we can have it for archive purposes.

### Fixed to an extent, probably because iPhone X support was removed for TestFlight; pushed through for archive ^.
