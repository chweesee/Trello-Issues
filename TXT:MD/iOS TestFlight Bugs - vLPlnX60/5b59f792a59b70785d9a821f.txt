Reported by Rashaun#9295

####Steps to reproduce:
- Type a message in the message field long enough to generate a scroll bar (I found copy pasting the example bug report worked for me) 
- Make sure you you characters that go onto right edge of the message area 
- After you get enough text to generate a scroll bar, start scrolling up and down, watching the scroll bar 
- If you can’t repro on the first try, try typing enough text to where the last character moves the word to a new line, and try replacing it with letters until you find one that doesn’t go to a new line

####Expected result:
Text wraps before the scroll bar area
####Actual result:
Text doesn’t wrap when hitting the scroll bar area, creating a bleeding effect where the text and scroll bar overlap
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.3.6 (6095)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s iOS 12 Dev Beta 4

### Can reproduce.
iPhone 8 Plus - iOS 11.4.1, iPad Air 2 - iOS 12 Public Beta 3, TestFlight 2.3.6 (6095) - Might be intended behavior though because there is not very much free space for the scrollbar
