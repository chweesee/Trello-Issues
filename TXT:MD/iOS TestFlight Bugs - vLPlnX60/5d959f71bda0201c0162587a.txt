Reported by .Gloria.#9606

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Discord 
- Call someone in Direct Message and/or multiple people in a Group Direct Message call (either works) 
- Have you and/or the other person spam the mute button (either way works + this also works on desktop as well with the deafen button if one is using iOS on TestFlight 3.1.4 (17524) and the other using desktop) 
- Observe. (This may take a couple of tries)

####Expected result:
The profile picture icon of yours and/or the other person's icon is not supposed to flicker when muting.
####Actual result:
The profile picture icon of yours and/or the other person's icon starts to flicker.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.4 (17524)
####System settings:
iPhone 8, iOS 13.1.2

### Can reproduce.
Can reproduce on iPhone 7 Plus - iOS 13.0 - TestFlight 3.1.4 (17524) This spamming also “queues” sounds of mute and unmute, which may persist beyond the call
