Reported by Gar#1865

####Steps to reproduce:
- Enable voiceover on your IOS device. 
- Open Discord 
- Navigate to any channel in a server. 
- Find any message, doublt tap and hold on the message until the action sheet appears 
- Place your finger on the mention button 
- Swipe left until you hear "close action sheet, button."

####Expected result:
The action sheet should remain open until you actually double tap the close action sheet element.
####Actual result:
The action sheet closes almost as soon as voiceover finds that element. However there is a delay of a few seconds before voiceover detects the action sheet has been closed.
####Client settings:
Discord 3.1.1 official release
####System settings:
Ipad (6th Generation) IOS 13.0.1 public beta 1
