### It is an Apple bug, yes, but Dabbit asked us to report it, so the iOS device can device whether anything can be done with this report.

### I am archiving this ticket as there has been no new activity on this ticket for more than a month (almost 2 months). Pascal#0929 also commented that this issue has been fixed in iOS 12, so this may be possible that it's not an Discord bug. - Ghoul on 2018-07-03T01:40:02.134Z
