### This may not be a bug as the attached gif may have been exported incorrectly in Photoshop. I managed to fix this gif therefore it was a problem with the gif. However, I'm not sure why this gif plays fine on desktop but not on iOS unless you open it in a browser.

### The same behavior appears to happen on this very trello ticket. It seems like an issue with the image and not with Discord. - Jared on 2018-02-13T21:21:30.084Z


### Archiving this card because it's been in the Won't Fix list for more than a month with no new activity. - Alexandru Todea on 2018-04-14T08:51:01.306Z
