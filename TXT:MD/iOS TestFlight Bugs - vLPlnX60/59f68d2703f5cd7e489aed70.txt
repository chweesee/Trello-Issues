### This is another case of intentionally destructive behavior. You'd only run into this if you were trying to break it. Still a valid bug, just super low priority. - Jared on 2017-11-07T19:46:34.070Z

### Also happens with the crown icon (for servers and group dms)

### Also happens with the mini profile of a bot.

### In addition to the cutoffs, the actual length at which they cut off is not consistent.
