####Steps to reproduce:
- Have or get a bot that can send rich embeds 
- Let the bot send a message with rich embed 
- Let this message be edited

####Expected result:
Above the Rich Embed (like for normal message) a info should be shown that this message was edited.
####Actual result:
No edit info will be shown. If you need an example bot for it, just use the bot "Nadeko". Use the command "(dot)timezones" for that bot and click on any arrow reaction for the bot's message.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 1.9.2 (953)
####System settings:
iPhone 6S with iOS 11.0.3 & iPad Air 2 with iOS 11.1 PB 2
