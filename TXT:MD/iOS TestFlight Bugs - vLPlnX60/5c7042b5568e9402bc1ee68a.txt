[Archived] Timestamps sometimes messup when someone has a really long name [iPhone + and X models only] (Found that the name “iloganator (Kappanatator9001)” works so if your having trouble try that) (https://trello.com/c/w0QRAvEC)

####Steps to reproduce:
- I found multiple ways 
- Way 1 
- Have someone with a really long name type in chat 
- Type after they type 
- Repeat the process a bunch of times  
- See if there are any missing timestamps with beside their name 
- If not completely close that app and re open it 
- If it still doesn’t work do it one more time 
- If that doesn’t work there is Way 2 
- Go into an active text channel in a server 
- Have someone with a really long name join, and actively chat 
- Leave the app but leave it running in the background  
- Do whatever (I was browsing reddit) 
- Come back and check the timestamps beside their names 
- Way 3 
- Do Way 2 except don’t leave discord just pay close attention to the time stamps

####Expected result:
It should show the proper timestamp
####Actual result:
It shows no timestamp
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.4.5
####System settings:
iPhone 7+, iOS 12.1.4
