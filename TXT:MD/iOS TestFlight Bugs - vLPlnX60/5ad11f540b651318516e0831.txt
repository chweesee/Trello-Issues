### Can reproduce.
iPad Air 2, iOS 11.4 PB 1, TestFlight 2.3.0 (3740)
Only happens when a channel with a member list was opened before using Discord in Slide Over mode. Temporary problem because closing and reopening member list fixes the issue.If you can't reproduce it, fully close Discord via Multitasking and try it again.

### I checked this ticket during the Trello Event with the new reproduction steps provided by Pascal#0929:
- Prerequisite: Force close Discord
- Go to any server and open a channel with a member list
- Close Discord by pressing the home button
- Open any other iOS app
- Open Discord in Slider Over mode (not Split View)
- Now open the member list of the channel

Unfortunately, I was not able to reproduce as I tried multiple times on two different iPads. :( 

I used iPad Air 1st Generation running iOS 11.4 and iPad 2017 Model (5th Generation) running iOS 11.2.6. Both iPads have Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560).

Since I was not able to reproduce, this ticket will not go anywhere, unfortunately.  - Ghoul on 2018-07-03T00:24:30.468Z
