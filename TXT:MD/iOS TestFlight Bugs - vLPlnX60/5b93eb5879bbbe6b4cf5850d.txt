####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to any text chat 
- Click on the paperclip icon 
- Upload a gif 
- Observe the inline gif

####Expected result:
You should see the gif tag and animation.
####Actual result:
It is just a still inline image. If the image is uploaded, it will be a gif though. Pasting gifs shows the gif indicator and animation too.
