Reported by Alfie#1582

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open the new create/join server menu 
- Tap the very top of the screen, where the time is, above either the server or channel list

####Expected result:
You aren't scrolled to the top as you cannot interact with the UI while the new create/join server menu is open
####Actual result:
You are scrolled to the top
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.4.0 (9477)
####System settings:
iPhone XS Max, iOS 12.1.1 Dev Beta 3
