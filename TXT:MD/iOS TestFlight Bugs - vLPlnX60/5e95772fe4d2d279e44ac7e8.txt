- Filter the members 
- Observe behaviour when scrolling down and up without enlarging the modal

####Expected result:
Scroll bar moves with respect to the screen and sticks to the header when scrolling up.
####Actual result:
Scroll bar moves down off the screen and shows what's behind the modal when scrolling up.
