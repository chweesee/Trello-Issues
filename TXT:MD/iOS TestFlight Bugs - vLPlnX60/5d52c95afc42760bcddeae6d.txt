Reported by Joel_creeper#6969

####Steps to reproduce:
- Use any iOS device that can use slide over 
- Open any large image that wouldnâ€™t normally fit into the slide over window 
- Observe the multiple possibilities

####Expected result:
Discord should fit the image into the window as normal
####Actual result:
Discord zooms it in, making it hard to move it up/down(because it thinks your swiping the image away) or it oddly crops it to the corner with large black gap
####Client settings:
Discord TestFlight 3.1.0 (16734)
####System settings:
iPad Air (WiFi), iOS 12.0
