### Can reproduce.
iPhone 6s with iOS 11.0.3 & iPad Air 2 with iOS 11.1 PB 5, TestFlight 1.9.3 (1286). This only happens when changing the country and the keyboard stays open. So click on the current selected country, click on the search and search for something, choose one country (keyboard must be opened). Might also be related to https://trello.com/c/4USoeAjr (but seems to be a different bug)

### CR, Did not have to change country when reproing the Bug, keyboard stayed open after entering phone number for verification then covered area to enter code (although you can still enter the code you just can’t see).
