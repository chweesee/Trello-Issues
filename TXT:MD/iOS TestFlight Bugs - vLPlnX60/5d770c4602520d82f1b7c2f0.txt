####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a server 
- Press invite members 
- Change the expiration time to never expires 
- Read the expiration date under the invite link -

####Expected result:
There is not supposed to be the extra words “Expires in”
####Actual result:
The wording is improperly stated due to the “Expires in” behind the never expires.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.2 (17237)
####System settings:
iPhone 8, iOS 12.4
