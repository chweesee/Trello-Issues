Reported by Pascal#0929

####Steps to reproduce:
- Give any role the permission to open the server settings (for example manage channels) but don't give the permission to kick members 
- Assign this role to any user 
- With this user open the server settings 
- Go to members 
- Click on the 3 dots 
- Click on the option `Prune`

####Expected result:
The prune members option should only be visible when you have the kick permission.
####Actual result:
The button is always visible but has no functionality, just a visual bug.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.2.2 (2352)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s, iOS 11.2.5 & iPad Air 2, iOS 11.3 PB 2
