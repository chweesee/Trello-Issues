Reported by Dru#8209

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Go to edit any role. 
- Type in a really long name that would be cut off on other platforms. 

####Expected result:
 The field stops accepting characters or throws an error when finished typing. 
####Actual result:
 The field allows any number of characters to be entered and submitted, and will set that as the role name, regardless of length.
