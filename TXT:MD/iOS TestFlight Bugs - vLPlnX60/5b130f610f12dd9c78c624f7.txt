####Steps to reproduce:
- Open any server and go to the notification settings 
- Set the notification settings to all messages 
- Close out of Discord 
- Go to another account and send a message in this server 
- Go back to your first account and open Discord again (not via the push notification!) 
- Go to the channel which caused the push notification and mark it as read (also works with a second device or the desktop app)

####Expected result:
Push notification should disappear automatically.
####Actual result:
It stays and only disappears after manually removing/clicking on it or when a new notification with a badge arrives.
####Client settings:
Stable 2.3.3
####System settings:
iPhone 6s, iPad Air 2 - iOS 11.4
