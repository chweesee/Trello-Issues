[Archived] “Message channel” appears before text is fully deleted and typing indicator flashes in the message when deleting text (happens for a split second and is easier to see on poor connection) (https://trello.com/c/EI3W7NRI)

####Steps to reproduce:
- Type some text in a channel (I find it works better with a long continuous string of text) 
- Delete the text you’ve typed, making sure to hold the backspace button 
- Observe the left side of the message bar as the typing indicator deletes the last of the text 
- If you don’t notice it, watch closely and try again (you can also take a screen recording and go through frame by frame to see it if testing on good connection) 
- If testing on poor connection it also works with deleting the text character by character depending on how poor your connection is

####Expected result:
“Message channel” doesn’t appear until the text is fully deleted
####Actual result:
“Message channel” message appears before the typing indicator is moved back fully to the left, causing the typing indicator to appear in the message
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.3.6 (6095)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s iOS 12 Dev Beta 5
