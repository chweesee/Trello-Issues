- Go to the <#197038744908333066> chat

####Expected result:
Discord responds to every tap without a very noticeable delay.

Discord doesn't respond to most if not all taps and when it does respond it's with a ridiculous delay.

### Can reproduce.
Can reproduce. iPhone 5s 11.2.6, Discord Stable Build 2.2.7. My phone isn't really powerful but in big servers it lags a lot indeed.

### This isn't a bug. When you open the member list it takes up a ton of CPU as it's trying to load a couple thousand people into memory. - Jared on 2018-04-12T21:10:13.803Z


### Moved from User Reported Bugs to Won't Fix by Jared on 2018-04-12T21:10:17.921Z
