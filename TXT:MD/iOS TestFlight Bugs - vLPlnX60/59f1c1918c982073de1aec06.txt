Reported by juj#5114

####Steps to reproduce:
- Be on build 1336 (earlier versions including 1286 don't seem to have the issue) and log out of your account

####Expected result:
You get brought to the login page of Discord
####Actual result:
The current screen that you see when tapping logout will be frozen and you can barely interact with UI elements, bringing up task manager/swapping apps helps a bit but you need to restart it ultimately to log in again
####Client settings:
Discord TestFlight 1.9.3 (1336)
####System settings:
iPhone 8 Plus, iOS 11.1 (PB5)

### Can reproduce.
CR but for me, it shows that Discord is attempting to connect to the account that is logged out. Still had to restart the app because it wouldnâ€™t work. | iPhone 8 +, iOS 11.0.3, Discord iOS TestFlight 1.9.3 (1336)
