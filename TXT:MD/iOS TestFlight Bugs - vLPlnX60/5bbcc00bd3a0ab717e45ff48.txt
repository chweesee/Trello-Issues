Reported by Techbot#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Click on an uploaded video attachment ( or similar) 
- Before the video is fully loaded and fullscreened (tiny video, not the white screen) press on the Share button

####Expected result:
Clicking on the share button should not affect the video controls
####Actual result:
Video controls are gone and you can only go back using the "swipe from left to right" motion
####Client settings:
2.3.8
####System settings:
iPhone 6s, IOS 12.0

### I can also reproduce this on Wattpad, so maybe it has something to do with the in-app browser the apps use?
