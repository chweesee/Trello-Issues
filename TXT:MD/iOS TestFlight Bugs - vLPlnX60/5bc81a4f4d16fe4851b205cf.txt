####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a server where you can manage channels 
- Make sure you have multiple channels and/or categories (I have about 60 channels and over 10 categories) 
- Go into channel settings, and click sort text channels 
- Hold down on a channel at the top of the list, and move it down slightly without letting go 
- Observe the position of the green box that marks where the channel will be placed 
- Put the channel back where it was previously, and scroll down to about the bottom of the list 
- Hold down on a channel near the bottom of the list, and move it slightly downwards without letting go 
- Observe the location of the green box that marks where the channel will be placed

####Expected result:
The green box marking where the channel will go should be underneath the channel right below it in both spots on the list
####Actual result:
The green box marking where the channel will go is moved further down the further down the channel list you go
####Client settings:

####System settings:
