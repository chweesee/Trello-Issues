Reported by Ghoul the Kitty#5678

####Steps to reproduce:
- Start a group call in iOS 
- Exit to the home screen. 
- Go to your desktop client, join the call then end the call once the iOS red banner for the call has disappeared. 
- Come back to the iOS Client 
- Go to the Group Overview. 
- Observe

####Expected result:
Group Overview should show all members with "Members in the Group"
####Actual result:
There is two categories, "In the Call" and "Not in the Call" even if no one is in the call. Do note, if you restart your client.. your client will start the call for some odd reason.
####Client settings:
Discord Stable Version 2.3.3
####System settings:
iPhone 8 +, iOS 11.4
