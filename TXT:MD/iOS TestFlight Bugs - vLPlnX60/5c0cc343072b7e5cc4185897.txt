####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a person send you a DM where the third line ends in a line break 
- Example: “Not if you tell your boss ‘no u’ Then they’re fired, and you take their job Not if you tell your boss ‘no u’ Then they’re fired, and you take their job” with linebreaks before each “Then” 
- Observe if the in-app notification ellipses
-  Have the same person DM you that message, but change the line breaks to spaces 
- Observe the in-app notification again for any ellipses

####Expected result:
In-app notification ellipses when the text extends past a third line
####Actual result:
In-app notification doesn’t ellipse if the last character in the third line is a line break
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.4.0 (9648)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s iOS 12.1.1 Dev Beta 3
