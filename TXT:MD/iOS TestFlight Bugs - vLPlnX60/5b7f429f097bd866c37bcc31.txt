### Not sure this is required by Apple and/or Google for this feature. - Jeff Cailteux on 2018-08-24T21:46:13.956Z


### I think it doesnt ask location perm for non beacon messages. But we added the description to info.plist anyway since apple detects the possible location usage from the nearby dependency. 

Also I suggest to update location description in info.plist to something generic. - Fanghao on 2018-08-25T07:33:48.037Z
