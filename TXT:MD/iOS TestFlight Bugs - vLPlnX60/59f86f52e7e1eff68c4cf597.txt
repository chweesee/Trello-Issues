### Cannot reproduce. The text is always lifted so that it's visible. iPad pro. - Jared on 2017-11-06T22:04:44.190Z

### Can reproduce.
iPhone 6s with iOS 11.1 & iPad Air 2 with iOS 11.2 PB 1, TestFlight 1.10.0 (1476). Still an issue for me, maybe only happens with smaller iPads like 9.7 inch iPad Air 2

### Possible that this could also be specific to iOS 11, as I can't reproduce on a 9.3.5 iPad. - Mike Nisbet on 2017-11-23T16:02:37.667Z
