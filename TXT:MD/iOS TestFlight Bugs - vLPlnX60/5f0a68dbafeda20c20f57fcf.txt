Being in a channel when every currently loaded message is deleted by someone else causes the load more messages button to disappear, so you can't view any messages in the channel without restarting (https://trello.com/c/xzzQi62A)

Reported by TollyThaWally#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Get someone to send 25+ messages in a channel you haven't opened since starting the app 
- Open the channel and get the person to delete their messages (don't press the button to load more messages, they may have to delete pretty quickly, getting a bot to do it might be easier)

####Expected result:
The load more messages button should stay so you can read more messages in the channel
####Actual result:
The load more messages button vanishes and the channel is blank, the only way to view messages in the channel is to restart the app
####Client settings:
TestFlight 19.0 (19670)
####System settings:
iPhone 6S, iOS 13.4.1
