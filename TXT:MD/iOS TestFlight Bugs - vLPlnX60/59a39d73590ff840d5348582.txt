Reported by Pascal#0929

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have/create a channel topic with the following conditions (see attached picture for an example): 
- First line of channel topic with normal text without Markdown formatting 
- Second line of channel topic is an empty line 
- Third line of channel topic uses Markdown formatting (for example bold text)

####Expected result:
Empty line should be shown after the first line. Although empty line doesn't seem to be supported for iOS, at least space should be shown.
####Actual result:
Space between first and third line is missing.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 1.9.1
####System settings:
iPhone 6S, iOS 10.3.3
