####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure you're able to receive in-app notifications 
- Open Discord and then put Discord in the background 
- Either have someone mention you, or use a bot to ping yourself on another device while Discord is in the background 
- Wait around 5 to 10 seconds so that the in-app notif would have appeared and disappeared 
- Reopen the app, and watch the screen for around 5 to 10 seconds

####Expected result:
In-app notif doesn't appear since the mention was already received and the in-app notif would have disappeared
####Actual result:
In-app notif appears despite enough time having passed that it would have disappeared
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.4.5 (11460)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s iOS 12.2 Dev Beta 3

### This sounds like it should belong into In app notification Category. So moving there. - Ghoul on 2019-04-02T04:59:57.186Z
