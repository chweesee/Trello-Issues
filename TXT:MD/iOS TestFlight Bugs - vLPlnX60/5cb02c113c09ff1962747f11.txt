Reported by üíênickWtnüíê#3789

####Steps to reproduce:
- go to user settings, text & images and either turn on "Automatically play GIFs when possible" or turn it off 
- now go to a web browser, go to Tenor and search for a gif (in my case I did mac and cheese) 
- once you find a gif long hold on it and select copy form the menu that comes up  
- now go do discord observe that it animates in the text box, then send it   
- observe that it animates in the text box, then send it   
- observer that it now does not auto play in chat 
- now go back to step one and do the opposite action you did on the  "Automatically play GIFs when possible", and do step 4-6 again  
- observe the results of what you did the second time and see how they are the same as the first attempt

####Expected result:
If the copied gif from a site like Tenor respected your "Automatically play GIFs when possible" settings it should either auto play in chat and the text box or it should do neither
####Actual result:
the gif copied form a site like Tenor will play in your text box but not in discord chat no matter what your  "Automatically play GIFs when possible" are set to.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.5.2 (13014)
####System settings:
iPhone XR, ios 12.1
