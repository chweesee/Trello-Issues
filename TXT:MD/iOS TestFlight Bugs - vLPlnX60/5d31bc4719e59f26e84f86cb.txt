### Can reproduce.
I can reproduce this on iPhone XR iOS 12.1.4 as of today. I was coming to report it but saw it was already reported. Hopefully it gets fixed because it renders channels completely empty

### A extension to this issue is that if say the message with the escaped emoji is at the bottom of the channel, it wonâ€™t make the content invisible but will only allow you to see the message with the escaped emoji in that channel and the message will follow you to other channels in the server, hereâ€™s a example video https://i.imgur.com/Suy0N3w.mp4
