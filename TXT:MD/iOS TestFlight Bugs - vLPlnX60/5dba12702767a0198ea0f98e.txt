####Steps to reproduce:
- Open discord 
- Have your alt spam your dms with letters so it’s filled quite nicely (make sure its text only) 
- Go to discord-testers faq channel and scroll up a bit until you see september 9 date on your screen (easier to repro there) 
- With your alt send a dm message to your main account (make sure in-app notifications are on) 
- Tap on the in-app notification 
- Observe the chat

####Expected result:
There should be no gap
####Actual result:
There’s a large gap in between text
####Client settings:
Stable 3.1.5
####System settings:
iPhone 11, iOS 13.2 (dev beta 3)
