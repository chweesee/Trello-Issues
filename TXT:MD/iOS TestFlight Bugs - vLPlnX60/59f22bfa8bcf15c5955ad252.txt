### The issue changed a second time:

Now the permissions language will change to the correct selected language but when changing the language a second time it wonâ€˜t change again, you have to restart your app first. - Pascal on 2019-07-29T14:37:18.008Z


### Cannot reproduce anymore as of TestFlight 3.1.4 (17575) with iPad Pro (11-inch) running iPadOS 13.1.2.

Moving to Claimed Fixed list. - Pascal on 2019-10-05T12:36:58.474Z
