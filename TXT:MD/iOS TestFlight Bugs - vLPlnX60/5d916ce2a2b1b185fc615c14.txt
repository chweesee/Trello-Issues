Reported by Ayu#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Be in an external call (Like a phone call). If you don't have a friend, you can try dialing your own phone number (It worked for me to allow enough time to repro, but it may be provider-dependent to call yourself) 
- Try to click the "Play" button on a video file in Discord

####Expected result:
The video should play; The audio should be a bit lower since you are also in an external call
####Actual result:
The video does not play at all. Clicking the play button causes it to go away for a second and then reappear.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.3 (17389)
####System settings:
iPhone 7 Plus - iOS 13.0
