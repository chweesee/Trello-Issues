####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a channel with slowmode being enabled (set it to a bigger time interval to notice the bug) 
- Make sure you don't have manage channels or manage messages permission 
- Send a message 
- Observe the timer that appears now 
- Close the app (force closing not needed) 
- Go back to the app after some seconds 
- Check the timer again

####Expected result:
Timer should continue counting down when the app is in the background.
####Actual result:
The timer no longer counts down when the app is backgrounded.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.3.8 (7416)
####System settings:

### Extension to this: the slowmode timer also jumps instantly to the countdown timer it currently is when typing something. If this note isn't clear, please see the gif i attached! Hopefully that makes it clear.
