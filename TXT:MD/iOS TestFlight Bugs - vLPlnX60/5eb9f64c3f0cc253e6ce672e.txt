####Actual result:
The textbox does not shift up right away, and you can't see what you are typing in the next line.

### This is actually not 4 inch specific. Upon further testing, I am to reproduce this on my iPad Mini 3 iOS 12.4.6, and my iPad Air 2 iPadOS 13.4.1, both running TestFlight 22.0 (19956). This bug may just happen on iOS devices that are over 5 years old.
