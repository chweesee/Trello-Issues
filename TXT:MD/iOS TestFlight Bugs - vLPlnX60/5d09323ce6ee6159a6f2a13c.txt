### I have updated to iOS 13 on iPhone XS Max with iOS TestFlight 3.0.3 (15738). At first, it was working just fine without any form of crashing before I went to bed. When I woke up and tried to switch from one channel to another, I immediately crashed and had to fully restart Discord for a bit before I was able to stop crashing.

I wonder if it has to do with cache, or memory on the device because it was left for 4 to 6 hours before I resumed the same season. - Ghoul on 2019-06-18T19:57:52.729Z


### RE: Switching from one channel to another. This seems to be frequent when viewing the announcement channel with a role ping, reactions, and gif. But this also happens when someone pings you and there’s a form of animated objects. 

This might be related to the gif related crash ticket. Although, when I switch channels sometimes.. Discord seems to pause as if it’s about to crash then resumes normally. (Related ticket: https://trello.com/c/kVaQ1g85/1647-ios-13-exclusive-discord-crashes-upon-scrolling-past-an-embedded-gif )

Will continue to keep track of this master and hopefully any information helps. - Ghoul on 2019-06-19T02:48:14.936Z


### *Xylium#5800* and *Isabel#0002* helped me testing that and all of the issue are fixed for both of them with iPhone X/6s running iOS 13 (Dev Beta 7) and TestFlight 3.1.1 (16898).

Moving to Verified Fixed list. - Pascal on 2019-08-19T09:32:19.192Z
