####Steps to reproduce:
- Type `:` and a character, the emoji list should then appear 
- Continue typing characters that matches one of the (custom) emoji's name (but don't type the whole name) 
- Don't type the second `:`, instead double-tap the word after the `:`. You will then be in editing mode 
- Move the editing mark around the word next to the `:`

####Expected result:
You would then move the editing mark around the word normally.
####Actual result:
The emoji list goes up and down (or down and up) every time you move the editing mark in the word, and if you move the editing mark out of the `:` and back to the word, the emoji list will no longer appear until you exit out of editing mode.

### Can reproduce.
CR, iPhone 6s+, iOS 11.2.1, Testflight 2.2.0 (1910) ; I think this might be an apple/iOS thing, as it interferes with the way Discord reads the text box to display reccommended emojis. If proven to be apple's issue, then I will revoke this approval.

### Can reproduce.
CR, iPhone 5s, iOS 10.0.1, TestFlight 2.2.0 (1982); Maybe NAB, due to the way the iOS editor works.

### Can reproduce.
iPhone 6, iOS 11.1.2, TestFlight 2.2.0 (build 1982) - Curse confirmed it seems to be a Discord issue rather than an Apple issue so should be passed through as a bug.
