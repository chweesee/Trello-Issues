### Can reproduce.
While playing music outside of discord, joining a VC causes the sound to change to the upper speaker and then the volume to decrease a second later. Leaving a VC causes the volume to increase and then the sound to switch to the bottom speaker a second later. The sound pauses with each change and creates a stuttering effect iPhone XR iOS 13.2 TestFlight 3.1.6 (18021)

iPhone X (iOS 13.2), Testflight 3.1.6 (18021) For me the music also sounds very compressed when itâ€™s played through headphones while connected to voice chat. That might be intentional, but just in case...
