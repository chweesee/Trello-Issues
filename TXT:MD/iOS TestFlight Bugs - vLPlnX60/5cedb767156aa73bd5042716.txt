### **Extension to the issue**
Leaving a Group DM or getting kicked from a server while the member list is opened, doesn’t defocus/close the friends list and shows it on the left side of the screen destroying the UI.

Attached a screenshot for it. The only way to make the app useable again, is by swiping on the left or by force closing the Discord app.

Therefore also increasing the priority to P2 Low. - Pascal on 2019-06-23T10:29:30.083Z

### **Fixed issues:**

- The original report 
- Leaving a group DM (you can no longer leave a group DM when having member list opened)

**Still happens:**

- Getting removed/kicked from a Group DM/server while having the member list opened - Pascal on 2019-08-25T10:48:34.525Z
