####Steps to reproduce:
- Create an invite on an iOS device and send it somewhere to view the embed 
- Look at an invite that you did not generate, or an invite you generated on desktop

####Expected result:
The number of members/online members should display on both invites, as it does on desktop
####Actual result:
The invite that you generated on iOS will only display the channel that the invite is to
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.6 (18021)
####System settings:
