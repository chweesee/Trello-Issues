### Can't reproduce.
Ignore my approval below, I tested it wrong. Only was able to reproduce because the server you searched for was opened but that is intended. - iPhone 6s, iOS 11.3.1 & iPad Air 2, iOS 11.4 PB 3, TestFlight 2.3.2 (4280)

### Can't reproduce.
I can no longer reproduce this bug, and thus ignore my approval. Probably because i had the server open when i tried searching for it. iPhone 6 - iOS 11.4 TestFlight 2.3.2 (4280)

### Can't reproduce.
first of all unclear reproduction steps, what do you mean by search them up? Do you mean type the server name or scrolling for server icon? Either way both did not work. iPhone 5s, iOS 11.3.1 TestFlight 2.3.2 (4280)

### Can't reproduce.
Both servers show up, make sure that you don't have one of the servers open while searching. iPhone 6s iOS 11.4 Public Beta TestFlight 2.3.2 Build 4460

### I am archiving this ticket as it has seen no new activity for over 30 days (almost 2 months). If you take a look at the comment below, they were on one of the servers that they attempted to search for (which was why they could only find one of them) which was intentional behavior.  - Ghoul on 2018-07-03T03:03:59.560Z
