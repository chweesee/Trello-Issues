### Archiving this card because it's been in the Verified Fixed list for more than a month with no new activity. - Alexandru Todea on 2018-04-14T08:58:14.490Z

### Can reproduce again as of TestFlight 3.0.1 (14776) with iPhone 8 Plus running iOS 12.2. Especially happens with smaller devices that donâ€˜t show the channel list when having a channel opened. Swiping to the left to open the channel list seems to be a more reliable way to get the bug.

Moving to Reopened list. - Pascal on 2019-05-11T16:31:27.980Z
