### Can't reproduce.
I cannot reproduce. iPhone 8 +, iOS 11.2.5 (Beta 2), Discord TestFlight 2.2.0 (1910).. Looks like it's fixed?

### This issue can still be reproduced with TestFlight 2.2.1 (Build 2202). You must just make sure that the keyboard is opened before you go the group settings

### I can no longer reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). After changing the group icon, I can no longer see my keyboard as it's completely gone. I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2). 

Because of this, I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-02T16:53:32.647Z
