####Steps to reproduce:
- Be in a server where you can create invites. 
- Open that server. 
- Tap "Invite Members" 
- Repeatedly toggle the "Set this link to never expire" switch until it says "You are being rate limited" 
- Tap the green "Invite" button next to someone's name

####Expected result:
The "Invite" button next to users should be disabled, as the Share Link button is below the "never expire" toggle.
####Actual result:
The app crashes.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.4.0 (9370)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s, iOS 12.1.1 Beta (16C5050a) - TestFlight 2.4.0 (9370)
