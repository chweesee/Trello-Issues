Reported by Pascal#0929

####Steps to reproduce:

- Rotate your iPad to the landscape mode 
- Make sure you have `Manage Messages` and `Add Reaction` permission (so all buttons appear) 
- Go to a text channel and send any message 
- In the same chat: Click on the message field to open the virtual keyboard 
- Long press on the message you've sent before 
- Close the virtual keyboard 
- Observe the last two buttons for the message interaction

####Expected result:
All buttons for the message menu should be visible.
####Actual result:
The last 2 buttons (Delete message and Report) aren't visible. Only touching them makes it visible.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.2.0 (2080)
####System settings:
iPad Air 2, iOS 11.2.5 Public Beta 5
