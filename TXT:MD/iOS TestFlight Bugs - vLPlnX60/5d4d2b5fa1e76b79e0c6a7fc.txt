### Can't reproduce.
iPhone 7, iOS 12.4, TestFlight 3.1.0 (16734) - It does a bit of an expected result more than the actual result in my end. Tried it with images, gifs, and videos. It closes yet it goes sideways for a quick second and goes back upright. It does take a quick second to load back to the chat.
