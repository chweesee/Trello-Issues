####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a role with the voice permission `Move members` 
- Have or create at least 2 voice channels 
- Create permission overrides for one of this voice channel and deny the permission for everyone to move members 
- Assigns the role you have created before to any account that is not an admin 
- Join a voice channel and don't leave it 
- Open your second account (the one with the role you have assigned) 
- Click on the voice channel your first account has joined 
- Click on the 3 dots 
- Observe the channels for the move member option and try to move it to a voice channel where you don't have the permission for it

####Expected result:
Only voice channels where you have move member options should be shown and work for moving members.
####Actual result:
All voice channels work when you have the move member role permission.
