### I checked this ticket during the Trello Event, and was able to reproduce this bug by following the new reproduction steps provided by QwakGoesDuck#0420. It will take multiple tries, but after clicking on several categories, I saw a server's name before it became the normal emoji category name.

I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2) with Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). Because I was able to reproduce this bug by following the new reproduction steps, I will move this ticket to User Reported Bugs for verification and include the new reproduction steps in the ticket itself. - Ghoul on 2018-07-02T23:17:16.858Z
