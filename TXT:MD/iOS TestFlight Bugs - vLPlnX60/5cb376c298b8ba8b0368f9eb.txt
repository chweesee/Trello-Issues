### I can reproduce on iPhone XS Max running iOS 12.3 Dev Beta 2 on iOS TestFlight 2.5.2 (14408). 

I want to note that this does affect performance. At first I was going to mark this as P3 high because of how uncommon it would be but as I tested it. I saw how it affected my client. 

Basically what is happening is that it takes about 10 to 15 extra seconds to get into the channel. But if someone happens to send a message containing the back ticks while you‚Äôre scrolled up - the client locks up. 

This can possibly be used to abuse, which I‚Äôm concerned about. So I‚Äôll label it as P2 low and move it to Notable Issues because I think it‚Äôs something that needs to take a look at. - Ghoul on 2019-04-24T01:04:14.448Z

### Now linked in the new master ticket for performance issues: https://trello.com/c/ccAallsK

Therefore moving back to New Issues and archiving. - Pascal on 2019-06-10T22:17:58.924Z
