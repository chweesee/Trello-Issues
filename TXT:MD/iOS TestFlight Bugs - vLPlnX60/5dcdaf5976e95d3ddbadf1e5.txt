####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to any discord server NOTE this requires the new discord ios UI so donâ€™t try if you donâ€™t it by new ui I meant the one that has all options on the bottom 
- Press the search option 
- (This wonâ€™t work the first time you do this so try atleast 9 times) Press cancel and then as your ios keyboard is dissapearing press the friends list button repeat this step atleast 8 times untill you get it to work. Also you may need to slide to the left side of your screen while doing this not sure tho.

####Expected result:
You should get into your friends list screen without any problem.
####Actual result:
You get into the friends list screen but at the bottom of your screen there should be a message saying channel is read-only/send message/follow and you wonâ€™t be able to exit the friends list tab unless you close discord
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.17
####System settings:
Iphone 8. Ios 13.1.3
