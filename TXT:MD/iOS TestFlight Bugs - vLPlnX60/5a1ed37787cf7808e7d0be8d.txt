####Steps to reproduce:
- Find any gif 
- Open this gif in the image preview 
- Click on the 3 dots 
- Save it to your photos app 
- Open the photos app and observe the image

####Expected result:
Gif should be saved with all frames and the animation. Note: Only since iOS 11 you can play gif animations in the photos app, lower iOS version can only save the gifs but not play the animations there. Sharing the gif with other app that supports the animation should show it for all iOS versions.
####Actual result:
Gif will be saved with only one unanimated frame.
####Client settings:
Discord Stable 2.1.0
####System settings:
iPhone 6s, iOS 11.1.2 & iPad Air 2, iOS 11.2 Public Beta 5

### Verified.  - Clayton on 2017-11-29T22:44:48.260Z


### EDIT: Clayton could only reproduce it on iOS. Apparently the "it also works on desktop" thing is a ruse. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-11-29T22:51:03.670Z
