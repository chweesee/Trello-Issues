### So another extension to this bug probably: I provided an attachment of it as well. Basically if you tap on the custom emojis category then scroll a little and tap away it will go gray randomly.

### This only happens if you don't have access to using external emotes, i.e. either not having nitro or having your permission to use external emotes denied
