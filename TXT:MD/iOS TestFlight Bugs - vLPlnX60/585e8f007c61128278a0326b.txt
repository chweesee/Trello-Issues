####Steps to reproduce: 
- Have a bot on two different shards. Set a different playing status for each shard.
- FULLY close out of all running instances of Discord. (Go to task manager on computer, etc.)
- Open Discord, then open the bot's profile FROM a server on shard #1. Observe the game. When you go to a server on shard #2, the bot's game is still the same.

####Expected result:
 you see a different status in the member list of servers that belong to different shards 
####Actual result:
 you only see whichever shard's game status was loaded first

### I can reproduce using the steps provided by Matthew#2334:

- Have a bot on two different shards. Set a different playing status for each shard.
- FULLY close out of all running instances of Discord. (Go to task manager on computer, etc.)
- Open Discord, then open the bot's profile FROM a server on shard #1. Observe the game. When you go to a server on shard #2, the bot's game is still the same.

Discord 1.9.3 (1340), iOS 11.0.3, iPhone 8 Plus

**Additional note from Matthew:** PM me if you would like to use the two servers I set up. After testing this, both playing statuses are the same on desktop too.
