####Steps to reproduce:
- Be on light theme 
- Create a spoiler, then pin or delete it.

####Expected result:
When the confirmation for pinning / delete message shows up, it's supposed to show a lighter shade.
####Actual result:
The spoiler box is shaded darker, like how it is when viewing spoilers on dark theme.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.4.2 (10773)
####System settings:
iPhone X, iOS 12.1.3 (Dev Beta 4)
