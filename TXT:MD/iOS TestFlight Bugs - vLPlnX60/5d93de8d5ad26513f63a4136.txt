Reported by Pascal#0929

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a text channel where you can send messages 
- Click on the emoji symbol to open the emoji picker 
- Observe the spacing between the different emote categories

####Expected result:
There should be more padding between them to use the full width of the category bar.
####Actual result:
They don't use the full space of the category bar. Also it is scrollable now even though there is nothing to scroll.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.4 (17524)
####System settings:
iPad Pro 11", iPadOS 13.1.2
