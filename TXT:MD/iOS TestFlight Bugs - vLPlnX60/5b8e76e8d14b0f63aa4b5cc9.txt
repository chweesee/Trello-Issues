### Extension to this is that it also happens when tap spamming emotes while clicking send from the emote picker. So, steps for emote picker: tap an emote from the emote picker and rapidly tap send. For this you might need to give it a few times as well so u get the hang of it.

### Another way of reproducing this bug is by letting someone send you a dm and as soon as you receive that dm, immediately tap send (assuming you typed something already) multiple times
