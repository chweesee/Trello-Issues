####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to server settings 
- Click on "roles" 
- Make sure there are a few roles (around 7 or so would be ideal) 
- Click "edit" 
- Drag one of the roles either from low in the list to high in the list or vice versa 
- Press "done" 
- IMPORTANT NOTE!!! This does not happen EVERY time. Please attempt to reproduce multiple times before denying this report

####Expected result:
The role will move to where it should go and none of the other ones will move
####Actual result:
Other roles also change order and it takes multiple attempts to make it work right
####Client settings:
iOS 1.8.3 (I think normal build)
####System settings:
iPhone 7, iOS 10.2.1

### Can reproduce.
Making a new role before moving roles around causing higher chance of repro, roles are not being reordered randomly upon save and instead being reordered to last known “good” order —> iPhone 7 Plus (iOS 12 dev beta 6, Discord 2.3.5)
