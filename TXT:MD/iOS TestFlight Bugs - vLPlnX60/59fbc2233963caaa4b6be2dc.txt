### Can reproduce.
CR, seems like it gets overlapped when switching from Japan Kana to emoji, TestFlight 1.9.3 (1340), iOS 11.0.3, iPhone 7

### Can reproduce.
CR, don't need Japanese keyboard for it, just switching from e.g. English keyboard to the emoji keyboard makes the keyboard overlap the text input (since they keyboard is higher and the input doesn't adjust). iPhone 8 Plus, iOS 11.2 (PB1), Discord Stable 1.9.5

### Cannot reproduce. The keyboards are the same height. - Jared on 2017-11-06T21:47:09.503Z


### Moved from User Reported Bugs to Cannot Reproduce by Jared on 2017-11-06T21:47:17.315Z


### Can still reproduce that with TestFlight 1.10.0 (1505). 

Other option to reproduce this bug would be to disable the suggestions for the keyboard and then opening the emoji keyboard.
