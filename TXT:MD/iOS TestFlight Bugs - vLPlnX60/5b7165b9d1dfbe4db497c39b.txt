- After typing part of the emoji, wait for the drawer to pop up and observe the motion 
- After the drawer pops up delete all the typed text and observe the emoji drawer as it disappears

####Expected result:
Emoji drawer slides in and out

Emoji drawer pops in and out, leaving a blank drawer when disappearing
