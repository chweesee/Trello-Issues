### Can reproduce.
Always happens right after you tap Forgot Your Password? with an email in the field and then pressing Okay, and then tapping Forgot Your Password? again. You'll see the word "Login" change to a loading circle but does nothing. iOS 11.0.1 (15A402), iPhone 6, Testflight 1.9.2 (953)

### May possibly be a cool down feature to prevent people from requesting to many password recovery emails.

### â€‹I was able to reproduce, steps provided by Ghoulish-Nightmare#4567: 

- Log out of your own account.
- Click on Login
- Put in a random email address (ex. johnthecat0293290@randomemail.com or something related to that.)
- Click on Forget Password (It'll show an Okay button on the top) 
- If it gives you the "Okay" button, just click on it then repeat the previous step. You will find that the 'Forget Password' button isn't always functional. You will have to repeat that at least 5 or 10 times, as well observe it

### Assuming that the "OKAY" button that appears is intended to be the forgot password notification, I'd say that it's erroring, probably getting rate limited, which would make this bug invalid.  However, the OKAY button thing is absolutely 100% a bug that needs to get fixed and I'm pretty disappointed that it hasn't been. - Jared on 2017-11-06T22:11:45.146Z

### The "Okay" button broke two weeks ago as part of an unrelated change. I've fixed it but it's being bundled with a few other changes that involve the login screen so it'll come in due time. - Michael Fong on 2017-11-06T22:20:48.362Z
