Reported by Solo#0007

####Steps to reproduce:
- Tap 3 lines in top left so you are viewing servers/channels/small piece of chat from left to right 
- Tap any icon that results in a pop-up (Server name, invite members, online status, search, recent mentions, user settings) 
- Immediately tap the create/join server button 
- Observe how the initial pop-up begins to display, but then the create/join server pop-up is displayed instead

####Expected result:
The initial pop-up should appear and the create/join server one should not show.
####Actual result:
The create/join pop-up buttons display and the original pop-up is hidden.
