####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to audit log. 
- Scroll to bottom of logs. 
- See if the bottom entry is expandable. 
- If yes, expand it. 
- Scroll down again to reach the new bottom. 
- Collapse it.

####Expected result:
All logs move downwards.
####Actual result:
All logs stay in same position. There is a blank space replacing the collapsed area. Trying to scroll will cause the screen to suddenly jump back to normal position.
