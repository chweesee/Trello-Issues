### Upon further inspection, and according to Pascal. It seems like English UK isn‚Äôt the only language as the 24-hour timestamp format is broken for all languages, no matter what it is.

### This was fixed on the backend. - Jared on 2017-12-12T21:57:24.020Z


### Moved from User Reported Bugs to Verified Fixed by Jared on 2017-12-12T21:57:30.139Z


### This bug was reported as fixed, but I think there has been some confusion earlier because Dabbit (Jared) had been using TestFlight instead of Discord Stable. 

This bug only occurs on Discord Stable, and isn't really fixed because Discord TestFlight is behind (last update was 27 days ago as of December 12th, 2017 while Stable updated probably 3 days ago. 

With that being said, I can still reproduce the bug on iPhone 8 +, iOS 11.2, Discord Stable App Version 2.1.2
