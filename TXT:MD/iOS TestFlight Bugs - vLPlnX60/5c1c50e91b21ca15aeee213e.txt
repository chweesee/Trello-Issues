### Can reproduce.
iPhone 8, iOS 13.1 (Dev Beta 3), TestFlight 3.1.2 (17237) - Gifs autoplay turned on also doesn’t show when sending a saved (from the gallery), cdn link, and website link, only as a preview when you have it saved in your gallery would the icon appear for both autoplay on and off. Gifs autoplay turned off only shows the icon if it is saved in the gallery when sent.
