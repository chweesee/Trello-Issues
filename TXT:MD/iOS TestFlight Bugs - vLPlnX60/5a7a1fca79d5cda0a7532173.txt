Reported by Pascal#0929

####Steps to reproduce:
- Mention any user, role, everyone or here or just have a look at the user names in the chat 
- Observe the user name or role name, user mention, `@everyone`/ `@here` mention font size/style in the mention (not the whole message itself)

####Expected result:
The mention and user name should be bold as for the desktop client to be clearly visible and readable.
####Actual result:
It isn't bold and often not easy readable.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.2.2 (2352)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s, iOS 11.2.5 & iPad Air 2, iOS 11.3 PB 1
