### Can reproduce.
iPad Mini 2 - iOS 12 Dev Beta 2 - TestFlight 2.3.4 (5530) - I'm getting 3 lines but it has to a very specific length depending on the screen size of the device, as I could not repro with bug-hunter-general-chat but with a channel name consisting of 79 characters.

### Can reproduce.
[CR] iPhone 6S, iOS 10.2.1, TestFlight 2.3.4 (5330); Seems like how long a channel name needs to be depends on your screen.

### I can no longer reproduce as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5548). The message bar no longer automatically change size when there are more than a specific amount of characters. It is now cut off by the three dots.

I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Developer Beta 2). However, because I am no longer able to reproduce this bug, I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-06-30T02:18:52.300Z
