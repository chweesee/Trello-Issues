####Steps to reproduce:
- Change your language to something other than English (for example German or French) 
- Ask someone to type something or use other account 
- Observe the typing strings (one user, two users, three users and several users)

####Expected result:
The strings should be translated for the respective languages.
####Actual result:
It uses always the English language. Note: For Desktop it is translated. Might also happen with Android.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 1.9.2 (953)
####System settings:
iPhone 6S with iOS 11.0.3 & iPad Air 2 with iOS 11.1 PB 2

### Verified.  - Clayton on 2017-11-30T00:31:40.248Z


### I was not able to reproduce this bug anymore as TestFlight 2.3.4 (5330). I used iPhone 8 +, iOS 12 (Developer Beta 2) and tested with German. I can now see the translation for the typing from one to three people. 

Because I was not able to reproduce this bug anymore, I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed, Needs Verification. - Ghoul on 2018-06-22T00:48:52.842Z
