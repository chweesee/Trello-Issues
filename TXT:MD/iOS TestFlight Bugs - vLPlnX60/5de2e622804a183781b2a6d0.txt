### The edited version didn't go along - you have to open a DM, close the DM from within the DM itself then repeat on another DM.

### Can reproduce.
iPhone 8+, iOS 13.1.1, Stable 3.1.8. Reproduced, but I could still switch tabs on the bottom bar, switching away and then back kept the same bugged screen, but was escapable by going to friends list then opening a profile and tapping the message button to open their dm.
