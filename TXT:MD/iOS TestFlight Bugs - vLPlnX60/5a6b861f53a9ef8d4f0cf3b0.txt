####Steps to reproduce:
- Join the the official Discord Feedback server (the real problem isn't clear so far, it seems you are only able to reproduce it when you haven't written something in the Discord Feedback server) 
- Open the search 
- Type the keyword `dabbit` or `Dabbit` there 
- Click enter and observe how the app crashes 
- If you don't get any results, search a second time

####Expected result:
The search should show all results containing the keyword `Dabbit`.
####Actual result:
After clicking enter the app crashes.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.2.1 (2236)
####System settings:
