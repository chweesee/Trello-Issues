####Steps to reproduce:
- Have SMS Auth disabled. 
- Navigate to User Settings > Account. 
- Tap and hold on the SMS auth switch. 
- While still holding, swipe left to return it to it's original off position.

####Expected result:
The switch shouldn't have any action due to the user putting it back.
####Actual result:
The SMS Auth screen opens twice. (I've got thrice on one occasion.)
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.4.4 (10993)
####System settings:
