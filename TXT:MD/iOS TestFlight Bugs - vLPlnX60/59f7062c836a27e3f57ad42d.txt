### This bug is no longer valid because the save gif option got removed

Pascal#0929 - Bug Bot on 2018-04-29T19:12:02.925Z


### I checked this ticket for the Trello Cleaning Event. This bug is no longer valid because eMagic has removed the save gif option, so it is impossible to be able to save the gif if there are no options. 

Since this bug is no longer valid, I am moving it to Won't Fix. - Ghoul on 2018-07-02T19:23:30.491Z
