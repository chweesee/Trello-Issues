####Steps to reproduce:
- Name a role with a valid snowflake ID (`<@number>`). 
- Delete the role. 
- Tap on the mention.

####Expected result:
The string should not be a mention.
####Actual result:
The string is converted to a mention, and tapping on the mention takes you to the private DM of that user after exiting the edit roles screen.
