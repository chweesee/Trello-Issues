### Happens on Canary as well.

### Can reproduce.
I haven't tested it on iOS but it partially occurs on Canary for Windows: The color does become grayer, but the avatar stays colored and there is a gray dot, and the name is still thick instead of the usual offline thin. Changing someone else's roles makes changes your appearance to the standard offline look. (Surface Pro 3, Windows 10 Pro 1703 (15063.296), Discord Canary 0.0.161)

### This is not a bug. It's intended that you can see yourself in the normal role color while having the offline status. Because of this not being a bug, I am moving it to Not a Bug. - Ghoul on 2018-07-06T22:28:51.683Z
