### I can no longer reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5330). The status dots are no longer tiny, but are at a regular size. I used iPhone 8 +, running iOS 12 (Developer Beta 2).

Because I was not able to reproduce, I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed. I have attached the screenshot of how it looks in the current TF. - Ghoul on 2018-06-24T02:32:19.606Z
