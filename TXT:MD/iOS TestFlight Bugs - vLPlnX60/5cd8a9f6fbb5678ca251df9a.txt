####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a server with a banner 
- Scroll down the channel list until the server banner disappears 
- Observe the amount of space between the top channel/category and the server name 
- Switch to a server without a banner 
- Observe the space between the top channel/category and the server name

####Expected result:
Amount of space separating the server name and top channel is the same
####Actual result:
Servers with banner have extra space separating the server name and top channel
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.0.2 (14873)
####System settings:
