### I can no longer reproduce as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). The embed now says that there's just one member instead of having both Online and Offline. I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 Dev Beta 2.

Because I was not able to reproduce anymore, I am moving it to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-03T00:48:32.385Z
