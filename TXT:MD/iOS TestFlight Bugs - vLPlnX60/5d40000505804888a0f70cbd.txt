### Can reproduce.
iPhone 5s, iOS 12.4, TestFlight 3.0.8 (16488) - On the Discord Developers server for example, the member list does crash and when you open it again to the member list on the server, it will either not load completely (aka infinity load), it would be blank, and/or it would blank and show the channel topic, depending on if you switch to another channel that has a channel topic on the server. (This could mostly happen when there is so many people on the server which makes it more difficult to load all the users, both online and offline. Although, Discord Developers did hid showing the offline member list. So it could be disabled for offline only or maybe both online or offline but I am not sure.)

### This issue is currently not reproducible due to a backend change that was made to revert the 100k server member hiding feature. - Ghoul on 2019-08-21T21:18:29.807Z
