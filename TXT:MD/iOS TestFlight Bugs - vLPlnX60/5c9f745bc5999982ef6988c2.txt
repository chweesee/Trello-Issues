### Cannot reproduce anymore as of TestFlight 3.0.2 (14902) with iPad Pro (11 inch) running iOS 12.3.

Moving to Verified Fixed list because EvilDabbit was not able to handle this ticket due to a issue it has with handling tickets that were in Claimed Fixed previously. - Pascal on 2019-05-16T15:20:21.872Z

### While the original bug is fixed I can still reproduce an extension (found by *Xylium#5800*): Posting any emoji followed by a ZWS in a channel topic crashes the app when trying to open the channel topic. For example `:shrug:‍` will do it.

Happens with Stable 3.0.1 (after the OTA update) and TestFlight 3.0.2 (14902).

Therefore moving back to Notable Issues. - Pascal on 2019-05-16T21:21:45.394Z
