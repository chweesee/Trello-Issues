Reported by JustGamer#2542

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a bot send you a rich embed message 
- Press and hold on the message 
- Press “Copy Text” 
- Try and paste the message in a channel

####Expected result:
Contents of the rich embed message should paste in the channel after copying
####Actual result:
The message does not copy, and thus when you try to paste it, it is blank/pasted nothing
####Client settings:
Discord iOS TestFlight, version 2.0.1 (build 1610)
####System settings:
iPhone 6, iOS 11.1

### Can reproduce.
Can reproduce. I actually thought this was in Trello because it's worked this way since embeds were created but I can't find it. So... yeah.

### I can no longer reproduce, there’s no longer a copy text option of the message doesn’t contain any text aside from the rich embedded one.
