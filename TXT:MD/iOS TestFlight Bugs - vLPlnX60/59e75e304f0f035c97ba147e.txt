### Can reproduce.
Only an issue since TF 1.9.3 (1165), not present on 1.9.2 (953). Issue is broader, anything chosen from the results below gets inserted in front of everything in the Search text (e.g. tap In: channel, then choose a channel, it puts the channel name in front so it'll look like channelname In: instead of In: channelname). iPhone 8 Plus, iOS 11.1 (PB3), Discord TestFlight 1.9.3 (1165)

### I checked this ticket during the Trello Event and I am STILL able to reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). The second option smashes into the username in the search as described in the ticket. I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 Dev Beta 2.

I will leave this ticket to be as I am still able to reproduce. - Ghoul on 2018-07-02T23:54:31.886Z
