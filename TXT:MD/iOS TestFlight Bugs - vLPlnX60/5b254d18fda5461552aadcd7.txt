####Steps to reproduce:
- Find any server or DM where you have never used the search before (they should have some messages) 
- Click on the search there 
- Use any filter or keyword and press enter to search 
- Observe it

####Expected result:
You should still see a loading spinner while the results are loading or the same screen as for the Desktop app (before searching we have to index the server/DM)
####Actual result:
You will see a no result page for a short amount of time before the results appear.
####Client settings:
Stable 2.3.3
####System settings:
iPhone 6s - iOS 11.4, iPad Air 2 - iOS 11.4.1 PB
