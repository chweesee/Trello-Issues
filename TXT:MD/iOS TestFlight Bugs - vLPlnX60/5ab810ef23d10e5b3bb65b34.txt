### I can reproduce with the steps provided by Rashaun, the keyboard definitely switches to letters after typing a colon followed by number:

- Click on the message box
- Type a colon followed by a number
- Watch keyboard switch to alphabets from numbers

### I can no longer reproduce as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). My keyboard doesn't automatically switch back to letters after sending the :100: emoji by Discord's method. I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2).

Because I was not able to reproduce this bug anymore, I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-02T23:33:18.209Z
