### is this still happening?: - Jonathan Wu on 2019-10-23T19:48:53.852Z


### @jonathanwu41 Yes, can still reproduce it. - Pascal on 2019-10-23T19:57:24.539Z


### @_pascal_ im not able to reproduce. Is this happening all the time or only sometimes? - Jonathan Wu on 2019-10-23T20:20:53.577Z


### @jonathanwu41 happens all the time for me. Just to make sure, the issue is iOS 13 only since it requires the new scroll bar scrubbing feature introduced with iOS 13.

You can now navigate by dragging the scroll bar.

I could also make a video when that would help. - Pascal on 2019-10-23T21:33:22.564Z
