####Steps to reproduce:
- Quickly spam-click the first reaction on a message quite a few times 
- Immediately long-press the reaction to open the Reactions menu, so that the reaction keeps adding/removing 
- Ensure that, in the end, the reaction is added 
- Exit the Reactions menu 
- Tap the first reaction a few times again

####Expected result:
When tapping the first reaction in the end, the message should not be selected as though you were long-pressing on it.
####Actual result:
The message and messages in other channels appear selected as though youâ€™re holding down on them.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.9 (18591)
####System settings:
iPhone 8 Plus, iOS 13.3 & iPad Air 2, iPadOS 13.3
