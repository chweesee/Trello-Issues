### I actually think this is iPhone and iPod issue only, as I am unable to reproduce on my iPad 2017 Model running iOS 10.3.2 with Discord TestFlight 2.2.3 (2572)

### I‚Äôm doing this mainly to address the fact that that this bug does happen in iOS 11.2.6 for me, I‚Äôm using TestFlight 2.3.0 (3817) as well and have an iPod Touch 6th generation. My reproduction result are the exact same as what‚Äôs depicted in the video that Kuuhaku posted.

### Can't reproduce.
I can longer repro this on my iPhone 6 iOS 10.3.2 as of TF build 3817. However, I know that some people can repo this on iOS 9 and 11 on their device
