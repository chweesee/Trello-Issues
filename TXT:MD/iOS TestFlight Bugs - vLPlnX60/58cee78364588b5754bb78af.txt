### Can reproduce.
iPhone SE 10.2, 1.8.3, Takes quite a few attempts, like 15 in total, but it looks like it adds up over time to become gradually worse as you use the app

### I repeated the steps listed 50 times and did not experience a hang. It took a little while to load a few times, but every other time was ~1 second to load. - Jared on 2017-03-21T22:29:41.839Z

### Can reproduce.
1.8.3, iOS 10.2.1, iPhone 6S. Doesn't seem to happen on all servers, only on large ones (except very large ones like Discord Devs) but apparently there's a treshold. It also only seems to hang if you open the app for the first time and don't switch to a different server/channel or different app while opening and closing the user list.
