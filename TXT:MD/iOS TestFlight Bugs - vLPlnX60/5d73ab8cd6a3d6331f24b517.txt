####Steps to reproduce:
- User Settings > Appearance > select "Light" theme 
- Open a DM with a friend and Voice call them. 
- Observe the red line indicating your microphone has been muted. 
- Unmute your microphone -> end call -> call again -> witness automatic mute with "Light" theme persist.

####Expected result:
On Dark theme your microphone is always automatically enabled, you would expect the same behavior from Light theme.
####Actual result:
Your microphone is always muted when initiating a voice call on Light theme.
