####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Discord and go to a channel where people are actively sending messages 
- Put Discord in the background for around 2-3 minutes, and open an app you had open in the background 
- After the 2-3 minutes have passed, go back to Discord, making sure the app hasn't refreshed from being in the background for too long 
- Start typing right as you get back to the app, and continue typing up through when Discord loads the messages received while in the background 
- Observe the text you're typing as the messages load in, but make sure to continue typing, even as the messages are being loaded in

####Expected result:
Nothing happens to the text
####Actual result:
Some of the text you type gets deleted from your message box
