### Extension to this issue for iPad only:

- Follow the steps listed above but do it with your iPad
- When you close the `Take Photo or Video` menu you will see a huge empty black space like in my attached image. 
- The only way to fix it is by opening/closing the keyboard

### The issue seems to be iOS 10+ only

### I can no longer reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). There are no empty space, or the keyboard being around for a split second. I tested on iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2) and iPad Air 1st Generation running iOS 11.4.

Because I am no longer able to reproduce, I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-02T20:25:32.461Z
