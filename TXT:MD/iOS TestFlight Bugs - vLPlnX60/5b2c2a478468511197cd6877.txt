### I can no longer reproduce on iPhone 8 +, running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2) with Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5425). I can no longer see the slightly different color block surrounding the text as everything in the background for search text appears to be in the same color.

Because I was not able to reproduce this bug, I am moving this to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-06-26T19:06:42.439Z
