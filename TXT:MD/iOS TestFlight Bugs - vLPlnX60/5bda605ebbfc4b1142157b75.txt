### Probably a won't fix, if you try to perform multiple touch actions while dragging it's likely to bug out and hard to fix.  - Miguel Gaeta on 2018-11-02T01:51:35.101Z


### Also this is a bug that only really happens if one is trying to intentionally cause weird behavior vs. just using the feature normally. - Miguel Gaeta on 2018-11-02T01:52:35.918Z


### Should be fixed in the next release - if not though do not reopen this as it's pretty edge case behavior that I think we should not go out of our way to make perfect. - Miguel Gaeta on 2018-11-02T23:24:01.405Z
