[Archived] mark read state is not being sent to the server, so reopening the app causes unread message indicators to act as if nothing was read. (https://trello.com/c/xR2IAxQg)

None

Created: Unknown
Latest Update: 2017-10-30T17:08:26.880Z

Steps to Reproduce:
1) load the app
2) go through all unread markers
3) close the app, either by just going to home (you may need to browse other apps if up going to just home) or completely closing it
4) reopen the app
Expected Result: mark read indicators disappear after being read
Actual Result: they keep coming back.
Notes: the markers go away on mobile but only after posting a message or by marking them read on the desktop app. Happens on iOS 9.3.5 under latest TestFlight.(edited)
