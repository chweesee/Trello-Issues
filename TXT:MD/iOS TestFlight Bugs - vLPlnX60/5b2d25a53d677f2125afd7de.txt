### Also to note, the enable diction module closes without clicking anything, only happens on Discord and does not happen on any other application. You cannot click on any of the options as it closes instantaneously. Please see attached video.

### I can no longer reproduce on iPhone 8 + running iOS 12, Dev Beta 2 with Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560). The voice input continues working as normal without any further action, and the module stayed open.

Because I was not able to reproduce this bug anymore, I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-03T00:04:01.285Z
