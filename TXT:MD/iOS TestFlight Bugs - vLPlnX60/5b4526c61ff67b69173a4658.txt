### I can reproduce this bug once again on iPhone 5S running iOS 11.4.1 with Discord TestFlight 2.3.8 (7106). The application instantly crashes if I have my keyboard up before sending a photo.

### 2.3.8 only - Victoria on 2018-09-13T21:07:19.360Z


### Extension to this is: 
- Be in a voice chat
- Force close discord
- After opening and being put back in vc, try and take a picture. 
This is how i can reproduce this on iPhone 6, iOS 12 - TestFlight 2.3.8 (7167) 
If u canâ€™t reproduce it with a different device, use an iPhone 6 on iOS 12, I definitely keep crashing everytime i do these steps.
