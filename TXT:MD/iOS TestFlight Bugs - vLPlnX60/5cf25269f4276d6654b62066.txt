### Upon further testing: Certain links (.gif, .png) are selectable in a message only containing a link. Certain links (trello) do not work in messages with or w/o other content, if allowed to embed, the link contained in the embed works. Certain links (Wikipedia) do not work in a message by themselves but do work in messages containing other text, if allowed to embed, the link contained in the embed does not work

### Tap on an incoming friend request, Swipe right, Double tap while the invisible accept button is selected, the users profile opens, reading their username, accept and reject again, but still selecting the hidden and now uninteractable elements
