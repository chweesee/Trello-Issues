####Steps to reproduce:
- Disable the microphone permission in settings 
- Join a voice channel

####Expected result:
The app should notify the user that they have denied microphone permissions and need to grant it to use voice channels.
####Actual result:
The voice channel is joined and it acts as if no audio is going through the microphone.
####Client settings:
iOS Testflight 2.2.1 (2202)
####System settings:
iPad Mini 2, iOS 11.2.2
