### I can no longer reproduce on Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5548). I can no longer delete all of the content in my messages then save as a blank message. I used iPhone 8 +, running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2). 

Because I can no longer reproduce, I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-06-30T03:28:25.898Z
