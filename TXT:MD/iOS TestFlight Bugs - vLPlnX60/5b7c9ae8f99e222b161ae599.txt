[Archived] Typing :[insertemojinamehere]: results in the first letter you typed being changed but only specific letters & I haven't tried all of them, i.e. :sn changes to :an. NB (s->a, h->b are known constants for me) NOT all letters do this. But s & h do. (https://trello.com/c/ZE0Ay2rl)

### Can reproduce.
iPhone 8 Plus, iPad Air 2 - iOS 12 Public Beta 7, TestFlight 2.3.7 (6846) - It seems the autocorrect still gets in the way of emojis, channels and mentions for the first two letters followed after the prefix and can sometimes cause this issue
