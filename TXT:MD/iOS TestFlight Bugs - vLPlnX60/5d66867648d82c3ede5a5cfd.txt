### Can reproduce.
CR. iPhone 5c - iOS 10.3.3 - TestFlight 3.1.1 (16961) [The message button works outside of voicechats just in voicechats it doesn't work. // The expected result is also not 'quick message button doesn't work', the expected result should be that the message button takes you into directmessages with the choosen person.]

### Can reproduce.
iPhone X, iOS 13.1 Dev beta, TF 3.1.1 (16961), user DMs show behind voice chat UI so it doesn't pop up until you close the voice chat UI

### Can reproduce.
iPhone 8, iOS 12.4, TestFlight 3.1.1 (16961) - It works but the message screen is behind the voice chat so you would have to use the v arrow in the group vc to do so.
