####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure you are on Online mode 
- Have someone mention you in a server with a channel mention for another channel in the server 
- Make sure you’re in a different server than the one you’re getting mentioned in 
- Tap the channel mention in the in-app notification 
- After the notification disappears, switch back to the server you were mentioned in 
- Observe the channel you’re in

####Expected result:
Tapping the channel mention should take you directly to the channel
####Actual result:
Tapping the channel mention only takes you to the channel when you switch to that server
