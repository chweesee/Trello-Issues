- Start a video call with another user (not a group call) 
- Rotate to landscape (anticlockwise)

####Actual result:
The PiP box is partially covered by the notch
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.2.0 (2121)
####System settings:
iPhone X, iOS 11.2.2

### This sounds like an issue about the iPhone X Safe Area, so moving the ticket to the iPhone X Safe Area list. - Pascal on 2019-04-03T18:56:57.856Z


### We are using now a new master ticket here https://trello.com/c/xebJZtcZ for all home indicator issues with iPad Pro and iPhone X/XS/XR/XS Max.

All issues will be transferred to the checklist there. Since this ticket is no longer needed then, I'm moving it back to New Issues and archiving. - Pascal on 2019-04-05T12:03:06.802Z
