####Steps to reproduce:
- Type and send an emoji unsupported by your iOS version, I used ðŸ©±. 
- Try typing in another message and it will type in what appears to be a typewriter font.

####Expected result:
It should write in the standard arial-style font Discord types in.
####Actual result:
Your typing comes out in a weird typewriter-style font.
####Client settings:
Stable 16.0
####System settings:
iPhone 6, iOS 12.4.5
