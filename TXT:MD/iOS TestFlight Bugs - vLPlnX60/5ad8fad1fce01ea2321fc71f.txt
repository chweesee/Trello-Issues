####Steps to reproduce:
- Open the profile of someone you have mutual friends with 
- Tap on the mutual friends tab 
-  Tap on a mutual friend 
- Use the iOS back gesture to go back to the friend list (not the back button in the upper left, but the gesture where you swipe from the left edge of the screen inward) 
- Wait about two seconds

####Expected result:
Nothing happens
####Actual result:
The screen you just swiped back from will reappear
####Client settings:
Discord iOS 2.3.0
####System settings:
iPhone 7, iOS 10.3.3 (14G60)
