Reported by Pascal#0929

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to any text chat 
- Click on the emote picker symbol 
- Observe the padding/spacing between the emoji categories

####Expected result:
There should be more padding between them to use the full width of the category bar.
####Actual result:
They don't use the full space of the category bar. Also it is scrollable now even though there is nothing to scroll.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.3.8 (7049)
####System settings:
iPad Air 2, iOS 12 Public Beta 10
