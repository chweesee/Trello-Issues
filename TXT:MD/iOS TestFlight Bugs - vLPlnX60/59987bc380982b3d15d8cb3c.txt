### I can no longer reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560) on iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2). The server never shows the loading gesture, no matter how many times I tried it. I believe that Lazy Guilds feature fixed this issue, which helps the member list to load quickly and more effectively.

Because I was not able to reproduce this bug, I am moving it to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-03T01:13:00.485Z
