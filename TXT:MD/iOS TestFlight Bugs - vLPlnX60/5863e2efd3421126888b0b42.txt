### that's a weird bug. Verified. - Jared on 2017-02-06T22:58:49.380Z


### Moved from User Reported Bugs to Verified Bugs by Jared on 2017-02-06T22:58:52.317Z


### Can reproduce.
iPhone 6, iOS 11.0.1, discord 1.9.2; it seems to be that until a lone codeblock is encountered (a block preceded by an empty line) all code blocks and their immediately preceding paragraphs end up at the top of the message in the correct order relative to each other.
