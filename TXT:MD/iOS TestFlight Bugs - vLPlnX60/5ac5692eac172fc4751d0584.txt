####Steps to reproduce:
- Find any user that linked a Skype account 
- Open his user profile 
- Find the linked Skype account there and click on it 
- Select the option "Open in browser"

####Expected result:
There should be no link or just the Skype app should be opened.
####Actual result:
Since such Skype URI user links don't work with the mobile Skype apps, the Skype app won't be opened and you get an error in your browser.
####Client settings:
Discord Stable 2.2.9
####System settings:
iPhone 6s, iOS 11.3 & iPad Air 2, iOS 11.4 PB 1
