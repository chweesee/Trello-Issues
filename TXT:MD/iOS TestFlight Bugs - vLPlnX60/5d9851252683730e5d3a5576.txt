### Can reproduce.
iPhone 8, iOS 13.1.2, TestFlight 3.1.4 (17575) - It stays on the screen like the attached photo and then I tapped the left to close it. This also does the same to Server Channels kind of except that when you put another channel, it doesnâ€™t take you to the channel, you stay in the current channel.
