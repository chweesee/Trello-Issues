####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure to have High Efficiency selected as Formats in Camera 
- Take a normal photo with the camera app 
- Upload said photo in Discord from camera roll 
- Download the uploaded picture from Discord (Open Original and then Save As in the CDN link) 
- Copy the original photo from phone to desktop via USB 
- Compare photo sizes

####Expected result:
The  that's uploaded to Discord has a decent file size (like other apps that create a  from a HEIC picture)
####Actual result:
Discord's  is way bigger, around twice the size of the original, thus HEIC pictures easily overshoot the 8MB limit
####Client settings:
Discord TestFlight 1.9.2 (953)
####System settings:
iPhone 8 Plus, iOS 11.1 (PB2)
