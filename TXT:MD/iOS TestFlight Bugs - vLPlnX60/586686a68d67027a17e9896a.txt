### After some testing in the Bug Hunter channel, we narrowed this issue down to being related in some way to GIF length, the file dimensions (eg 1280x720) and possibly some other factor. We determined that the gif's size (ie 5MB) is NOT a factor, as some 9MB animated gif's were not crashing devices due to them being short.

### the following gif, when tapping the embedded version, crashes for me on ipad 4th gen, latest build. Going to the gif directly in a web browser on the app does not cause a crash. http://i.thedrutribe.us/b16c8d32.gif
