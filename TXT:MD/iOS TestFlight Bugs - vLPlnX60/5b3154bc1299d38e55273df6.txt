### I can no longer reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5548). The description for @everyone and @here are now in German, rather than in English. I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Developer Beta 2).

Because I was not able to reproduce this bug anymore, I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-06-30T05:40:47.260Z
