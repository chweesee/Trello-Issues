Reported by AgentManafesta#4891

####Steps to reproduce:
- On your iPhone or iPad, enable voiceover. (Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver) 
- Double tap the Discord icon 
- When launched, you will get an error saying that discord unexpectedly crashed. Or something around those lines 
- Turn off voiceover and tap the relaunch button. Discord should launch. Reenabling voiceover will again crash the app.

####Expected result:
The app should crash. It will not bring you to your home screen, however it will not let you use the app unless voiceover is off.
####Actual result:
The app should launch with voiceover both on and off.
####Client settings:
3.1.8 (18423)
####System settings:
iPhone 11 Pro Max, iOS 13.3 Beta 3
