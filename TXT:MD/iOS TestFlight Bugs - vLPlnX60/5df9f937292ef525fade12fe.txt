- Switch to the iOS camera app and scan a QR code used for logging in to Discord servers on an invite page 
- Choose to open the link in Discord 
- Close the camera view in Discord that just open -You will now be stuck on the "Nearly there" screen for QR login in your iOS Discord app, with the interface for choosing a recent picture open in the bottom third of the screen

The interface for choosing a recent picture is supposed to close when exiting the camera view so that QR login works
####Actual result:
This interface doesn't close and is unable to be closed, covering up the QR login button
