### Verified this issue still occurs as of iOS TestFlight 1.8.0 (56) - Jared on 2016-12-19T23:55:25.539Z


### This still happens but now it opens the chat with the person just in the background. If you disconnect from voice chat or leave the voice chat, it will open the direct message with this person.
