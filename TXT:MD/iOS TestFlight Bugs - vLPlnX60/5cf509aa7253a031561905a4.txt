####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure to have the ‚ÄúAdd Photos Only‚Äù option in the Photos permission for Discord. If you have it, only proceed with step #3; otherwise just follow the steps below 

- Uninstall Discord and then redownload 

- Open an image directly uploaded to Discord and try to save it by tapping on the three dots button on top right and ‚Äúsave content‚Äù 

- After you hit save content, you‚Äôll get two permission prompts consecutively; ALLOW the first one and then DENY the second.

####Expected result:
Images should save into your photo library.
####Actual result:
The app says ‚ÄúContent Saved!‚Äù and no image is ever saved into your photo library.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.0.2 (15283)
