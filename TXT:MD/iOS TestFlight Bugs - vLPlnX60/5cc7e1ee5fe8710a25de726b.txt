### Can reproduce.
Can reproduce on iPhone XS Max running iOS 12.3 Dev Beta 1 - iOS TestFlight 3.0.1 (14476). Dapproving this report because of the severity of the bug, as you are unable to log in, or log out at all without crashing.

### CR iPhone XS Max running iOS 12.3 Dev Beta 1 - iOS TestFlight 3.0.1 (14476).

Labeling it as P0 low. This is a severe issue, where if you log out or you just have reinstalled the app. You will not be able to log in at all, without the client crashing.

Moving to Notable Issues. - Ghoul on 2019-04-30T05:51:51.755Z

### This was suggested that it's possibly related to this issue here: https://trello.com/c/ngSW5e9v

If you feel like it's a duplicate, plz ping me about it (that goes to the devs).

But for now, I'm going to reference it and leave this bug to be until an iOS dev can review this. - Ghoul on 2019-04-30T06:11:32.682Z
