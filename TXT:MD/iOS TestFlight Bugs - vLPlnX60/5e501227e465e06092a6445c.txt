####Steps to reproduce:
- Firstly, go to a server and select a DIFFERENT channel to what you will be pinged on. Ideally scroll down so you can't see the channel you'll be pinged on. It should have quite a lot of channels. 
- Next, get someone to ping you in the chat. 
- Notice how the "New Messages" red ping bar doesn't appear, if you scroll to the bottom of the channel list, the red bar appears but otherwise when you scroll back up it disappears.

####Expected result:
The "New Mention" red bar should appear until the channel you have been mentioned in is in view.
####Actual result:
The "New Mention" bar doesn't show unless you are at the bottom of the channel list.
