####Steps to reproduce:
- While in a text channel, press the @ key (to start mentioning a user) 
- Observe the status icons in the list that pops up above the message bar. (if necessary, type a few letters to bring up users)

####Expected result:
The status icons are of normal size relative to the user picture. The colour is clearly visible.
####Actual result:
The status icons are very small, almost only one pixel. The colour of the dot is hard to determine.
####Client settings:
Stable 2.3.5
####System settings:
iPad 2, iOS 9.3.5
