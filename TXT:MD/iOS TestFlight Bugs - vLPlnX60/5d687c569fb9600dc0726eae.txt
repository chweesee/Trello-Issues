####Steps to reproduce:
- Have more than 12 channels in a server. Needs to be large enough where you have to scroll down to see them all in Server Settings > Channels 
- Join a VC channel in the same server. Doesn’t seem to matter what VC channel it is.  
- Attempt to go to Server Settings > Settings > Channels. After loading the list gets cut off but the app still lets you scroll, thinking there are channels but won’t populate.  
- Leave the VC and go to Server Settings > Settings > Channels and now the list will fully populate.

####Expected result:
The Channels screen should show all Categories, Text Channels and Voice Channels
####Actual result:
List only generates the first screen but can still scroll down showing the rest blank
####Client settings:
3.1.1
####System settings:
iOS 12.4
