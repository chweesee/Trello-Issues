Reported by Xylium#1480

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a role named (for example: Mythix) 
- Have a user named the same name as the role 
- Spell out the user normally (Without its #{number})

####Expected result:
User should be mentioned fine without the role being tagged
####Actual result:
Role gets tagged instead of the user
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.3.1 (4051)
####System settings:
iPhone 6 - iOS 11.4
