### Can reproduce.
Admin approving due to the severity of the issue, and considering of how this version of TestFlight is supposed to be an release candidate. Can reproduce on iPhone 5S running iOS 11.4.1 on iOS TestFlight 2.5.2 (14382). When I attempt to open the app, it tries to load before crashing and I am not able to get into Discord at all.
