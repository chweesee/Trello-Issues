Reported by ðŸŽƒ Spoopy juj ðŸŽƒ#5114

####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure to have appearance set to the light theme 
- Go to User Settings => Account, where you can set e.g. username 
- Observe the Save button colour, it's dark grey-ish (both disabled/before any changes and enabled/after changing e.g. username, the button is dark compared to the Back button) 
- You can compare it with the Dark theme (this part of the interface should look the same, the Save button here is properly white/same as Back)

####Expected result:
The Save button is the same shade of white as the Back button (and the save when using the dark theme since these settings use the same appearance in both)
####Actual result:
The Save button's colour is off, it's pretty dark grey (on disabled state barely readable)
####Client settings:

####System settings:
