Reported by Jiralite#1207

####Steps to reproduce:
- Join a voice channel in a server 
- Have the voice chat menu open 
- Be called and accept

####Expected result:
The voice chat menu doesn't carry over to your direct call.
####Actual result:
The voice chat menu carries over to your call. Interestingly, deciding to rejoin the server voice channel will still make you linger in the direct call, and if the other user leaves, the screen still carries on.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.8 (18423)
####System settings:
iPhone 7: iOS 13.2.3
