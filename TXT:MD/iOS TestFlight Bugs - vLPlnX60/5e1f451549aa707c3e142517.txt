####Steps to reproduce:
- Tell someone to send an emote from a server you don’t share with him 
- Hold the emote 
- Click “Copy Text” 
- Paste it in the same channel

####Expected result:
It will just show :test: as an example in the normal text size
####Actual result:
It shows :test: but the size of the message is the same size as it would’ve been if the emote was posted
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.9
####System settings:
iPhone X, iOS 13.2.3
