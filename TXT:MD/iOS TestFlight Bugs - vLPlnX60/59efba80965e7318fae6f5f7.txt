None

Created: 2017-10-24T22:11:12.256Z
Latest Update: 2019-07-12T17:27:47.657Z

Reported by Pascal#0929

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to any text chat 
- Click on the paperclip icon 
- Observe it

####Expected result:
There shouldn't be such a white space below the options to upload/share a file.
####Actual result:
There is a big white space. For iPhone it only seems to happen when there are no recent images, for iPad it also happens with recent images. This white space issue can also happen with other places for the file/image upload menu like `All photos` for iPad.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 1.9.3 (1268)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s with iOS 11.0.3 & iPad Air 2 with iOS 11.1 PB 5
