####Steps to reproduce:
- Open an image sent in a read-only channel. 
- Click on the top right hand corner to open the share dialogue. 
- Select Discord.

####Expected result:
You must select a valid share to channel, else the image cannot be posted.
####Actual result:
Share to channel is defaulted to the read-only channel and only changes if another valid channel is manually selected. Pressing Post will produce "Unable to share. A network error has occurred or you are not currently logged in. Launch Discord, check your network settings, and try again." error.

### You got the wrong bug here. The problem is that you can try to share to a channel you don't have the permissions to. The network error is actually expected in this situation. Archiving. - Jared on 2018-04-12T22:03:51.879Z
