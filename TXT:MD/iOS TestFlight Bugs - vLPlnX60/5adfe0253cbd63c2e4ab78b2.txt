### Can reproduce.
Can Repro. I’m able to see what reporter is seeing (attached image). There is a “drop shadow” above the text. It seems like your eyes are unfocused but it’s really the text. Also visible without zoom. Able to constantly repro. Also, for the # placement question, that is intended. The “search keyboard” has a Search Button in place of the @ and # button on the bottom right. That is intended on Apple’s side. The @ and # on the bottom right appears on the “regular keyboard.” iPhone 8 iOS 11.3 TF 2.3.p (3817)

### Can reproduce.
iPhone 8 Plus, iOS 11.4 — Discord TestFlight 2.3.0 (3817). It is extremely hard to see, make sure you take a screenshot and zoom in the screenshot so you can see the issue.

### I can still reproduce this bug as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560) on iPhone 8 +, iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2). I can understand why people would assume that it's fixed, but the only good way to check is to take a screenshot then to zoom in the text as shown here: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/391730272388907018/463515978970693650/image.png

You can barely see it, but it's still there. Because I am still able to reproduce this ticket, I will leave it here. - Ghoul on 2018-07-03T01:28:09.615Z


### Now it only happens when typing a very long username such as `WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW`

### **Extension: Discriminator goes beyond the text field**
As of the UI redesign introduced with TestFlight 3.1.4 the discriminator can go beyond the text field as you can see in the attached screenshot when the username is long enough. - Pascal on 2019-10-03T11:05:05.622Z
