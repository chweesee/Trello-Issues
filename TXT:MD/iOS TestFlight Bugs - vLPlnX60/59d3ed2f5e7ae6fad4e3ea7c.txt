Reported by Ƭ☰SLΛ#2542

####Steps to reproduce:
- Join an active voice channel. 
- Hit the home button, and try to play Youtube, or Pandora, or some other source.

####Expected result:
Discord should "pause" or quit the voice channel. (Ex: Pandora would stop playing music if I switched over to Youtube).
####Actual result:
Discord voice chat will mute the external source and just keep the voice channel live.
####Client settings:
1.9.2 (953)
####System settings:
IPhone 6s, 11.0.1

### This isn't a bug. We're not a music streaming service like Pandora, we intentionally don't drop the connection. - Jared on 2017-10-25T22:58:54.403Z
