Reported by ZX ////#3405

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a brand new alt (with no servers) 
- Sign in to that account  
- Log out  
- Log in to your main account 
- Scroll down to the bottom  
- Scroll even past that (to see the box) 
- Observe the scroll bar 
- Note: I am aware that Trello report `ttXBjQmg` exists, but I am reporting how the box is behind the scroll bar, not how the previous user data is there

####Expected result:
`1.` The box doesn't show up at all (or) `2.` The box is placed above the scroll bar
####Actual result:
Box is shown and placed behind the scroll bar
####Client settings:
Testflight 2.4.5 11524
####System settings:
iPad 9.7" // iOS 12.1.4
