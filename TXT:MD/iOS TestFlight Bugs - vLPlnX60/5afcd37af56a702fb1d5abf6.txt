####Steps to reproduce:
- Have permissions to manage server, manage channels, and manage roles (DO NOT HAVE ADMIN)

- Go to any text channel

- Select permissions

-  Select any role

-  Change "Manage webhooks" from neutral, to false or positive (doesnt matter which one)

####Expected result:
App warns you that you cannot change that permission (like it does on PC), or nothing happens
####Actual result:
App completely crashes
####Client settings:
iOS app version: 2.3.1
####System settings:
iOS 11.2.1
