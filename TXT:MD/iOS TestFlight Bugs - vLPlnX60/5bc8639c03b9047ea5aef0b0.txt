####Steps to reproduce:
- Enable STT by pressing the microphone button near the spacebar 
- Activate the Emoji picker by pressing the 'smiley face' 
- Start/continue talking

####Expected result:
When activating the Emoji picker, Discord should deactivate Speech-to-text, like it does when you try to attach an image
####Actual result:
Speech-to-Text remains active, capturing your voice
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.3.9 (8385)
####System settings:
iPhone 8+ \\ iOS 12.0 (16A366)
