### The original issue now longer happens due to the redesign and the removal of the back button but the extensions with the same root cause still happens, here are some examples how to get it:

### I get this mostly from the three extensions that Pascal mentioned.

### Can reproduce.
Card should be rewritten imo, original functions have been removed but extensions can still be made. For the chatbox experiment, this is reproducible by tapping the gift icon twice and closing the screen that comes up.
