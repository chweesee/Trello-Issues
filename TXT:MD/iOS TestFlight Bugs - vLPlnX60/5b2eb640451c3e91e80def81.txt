Reported by ItzTacoTimee#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to any discord where you have permissions to send text messages 
- Type a sentence 
- Press the return button and don’t type anything there 
- Go back to the previous sentence and try to type other stuff, it should keep switching to capitalised letters.

####Expected result:
The letters I type in a different part of the text won’t become capitalised and I keep type normally.
####Actual result:
The letters I type in a different part of the text become capitalised, which is annoying.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.3.4
####System settings:
iOS 11.4, Apple iPad Air 2
