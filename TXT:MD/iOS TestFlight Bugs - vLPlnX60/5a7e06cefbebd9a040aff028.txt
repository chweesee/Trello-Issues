Reported by FanStalin#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Upload a movie file from your phone 
- Someone else can upload a file too 
- Try to click on the placeholder

####Expected result:
There should be a clickable link of the video file which launches your default web-browser to view movie file
####Actual result:
Discord shows the default image placeholder (the one before preview generated) and says "Failed to load the image."
####Client settings:
Discord TestFlight v2.2.2 (2352)
####System settings:
iPhone 7+ iOS 11.3 beta 2 (15E5178f)

### I can no longer reproduce as of Discord TestFlight 2.3.4 (5560), there is no default image placeholder that will tell me that it has failed to save the image. It will open the .mov file just fine as I am able to view it. I used iPhone 8 + running iOS 12 (Dev Beta 2).

Because I was not able to reproduce anymore, I am moving it to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-03T00:40:14.400Z
