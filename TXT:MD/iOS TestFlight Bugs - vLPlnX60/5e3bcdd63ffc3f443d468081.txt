####Steps to reproduce:
- Switch to Discord Light Theme 
- Have a bot send an Embed with Fields, I’m using Tatsumaki to demonstrate this with the *server command 
- View the Embed Fields and Notice that all text is Is the same black whether of it being a field or not

####Expected result:
Field Text Color should be a gray instead of black, like how it is on PC
####Actual result:
Field Text Color is Black like the Text Color of the Description in an Embed
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.10
####System settings:
iPhone 7+, iOS 11.3
