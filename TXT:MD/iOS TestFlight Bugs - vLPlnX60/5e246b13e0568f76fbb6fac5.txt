####Steps to reproduce:

- Bring up the native iOS emoji keyboard 
- Hold that emoji until it’s skin tone variants show up 
- Choose any of the skin tones  
- Spam click it until it appears in the frequently used emotes window

####Expected result:
All emotes should render normally
####Actual result:
All emotes render except for those which have a different skin tone (anything non-yellow)
####Client settings:
TestFlight 3.1.9 (18591)
####System settings:
