####Steps to reproduce:

- Create an rich embed with a bot or webhook 
- Add a title with a link to this rich embed 
- Use Markdown for this link (e.g. `**`) 
- Now go to Discord and try to click on this title link with your iOS device

####Expected result:
Embed title should link to the page you have added.
####Actual result:
Link doesn't work (note only the Markdown part doesn't link, so crossing out the full title makes it completely not linkable)
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.2.1 (2202)
####System settings:
iPhone 6s, iOS 11.2.2 | iPad Air 2, iOS 11.2.5 PB 6
