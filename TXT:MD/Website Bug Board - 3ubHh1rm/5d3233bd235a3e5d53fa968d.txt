Reported by Aeria#9096

####Steps to reproduce:
- Visit /developers and select an Application or make a new one 
- Go to the Rich Presence Tab 
- Upload a valid Invite/Cover Image or Asset Image and save your changes 
- Observe how it loads a bit 
- Now click the "Remove" Button under the Cover Image or the X on the Asset Image and click save again 
- Observe how the save Button immediately vanishes 
- Reload the page and observe

####Expected result:
The image should get deleted and not re-appear on a reload
####Actual result:
The Cover Image stays. For Asset Images, removing multiple times leads to an Error and they vanish eventually.
####Client settings:
Chrome Version 75.0.3770.142 (64-bit)
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro x64
