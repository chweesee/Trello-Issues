Reported by Alipoodle#5025

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to the new Marketing page for Nitro : discordapp/nitro 
- Scroll down to "Get access to over $1,000 worth of games" 
- Scroll (left and right) through the games, and notice the last game on either side is just out of reach of scrolling too 
- (Don't use 2 fingers as this seems to cause it to allow over scrolling)

####Expected result:
You are able to scroll through all of the games!
####Actual result:
Games on the edges are just out of reach and cannot easily be seen!
####Client settings:
Canary Discord - Chrome 69.0.3497.100
####System settings:
