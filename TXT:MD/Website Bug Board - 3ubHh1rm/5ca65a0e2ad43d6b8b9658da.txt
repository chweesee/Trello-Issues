Reported by TheForbiddenAi#7549

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to the developer portal 
- Go to teams 
- Make a team or select a team that YOU OWN 
- Once in the team overview page go to the url bar and after the "/information" add a number or character that isn't a space or % 
- Observe how the page has gone blank instead of redirecting you back to the team information page like it does for teams you do not own 
- NOTE: First attempt in the gif is this bug, second attempt in the gif is for proof of concept showing the bug does not work on teams you do not own

####Expected result:
It should redirect you back to the team information tab like it does for teams that you do not own
####Actual result:
The page goes blank
####Client settings:
Chrome 73
