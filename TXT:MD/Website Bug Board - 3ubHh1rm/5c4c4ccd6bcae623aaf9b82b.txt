Reported by ginkoid#8888

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to the discord developer console (https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) 
- Use an existing application or Create a new application 
- Go to "app whitelist" on the sidebar 
- Invite an alt account 
- Observe the game name in the email that you received on the alt account's email

####Expected result:
The game's name should be in the email
####Actual result:
The game's name is replaced by a memory address on the discord server (like "object at 0x7f2f9f4ec650")
####Client settings:
There's no version in the console, so the canary developer portal on 2019-01-26
####System settings:
Chrome Stable 71.0.3578.98, Windows Home 1809
