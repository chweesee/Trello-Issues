### Looked into this a bit. Root cause is our custom JS to allow click & drag to scroll horiz. I experimented with standard horiz scrolling (`overflow-x: scroll`) which fixes this issue and prevents other weirdness on mobile, but didn't get to re-implementing the click-to-drag functionality again. - Joey Baker on 2018-12-13T19:37:00.260Z
