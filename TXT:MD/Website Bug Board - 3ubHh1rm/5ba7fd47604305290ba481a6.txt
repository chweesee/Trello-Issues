####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to the discordapp website and add a second slash ("/") at the end of the link. 
- Obverse the page. 
- Now try adding a text that should work after the double slash, "branding" for example 
- Observe the page again. 
- Add a random text after the double slash and observe.

####Expected result:
The page is properly shown in all the cases.
####Actual result:
In the first case the page has a black background and the text is hard to read, also the whole page is messed up (the text and images's position are wrong); in the second case the colours are inverted and the positions are not correct, also the 404 GIF covers part of the text; in the last case the error 404 page is properly shown.
####Client settings:
Crossplatform, tried with Safari 12.0 (unsupported), Firefox 62.0.2 and Google Chrome Canary for Android 71.0.3557.2
####System settings:
MacBook Pro 2017, macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 (17G65)
