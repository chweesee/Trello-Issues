Reported by ginkoid#8888

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to the developer portal 
- Create (or rename) an application so its name is very long, and doesn't have places where linebreaks could be placed (128 Ws work well) 
- Go to "OAuth2", and create a redirect url (the value doesn't matter) 
- Use the URL generator to make an OAuth2 authorize URL for your application (the scopes don't matter) 
- Visit the URL, and give your application access to your own account 
- Go to the main app 
- Open settings, and click on "authorized apps"

####Expected result:
The application name should be truncated, and the "deauthorize" button should remain on screen
####Actual result:
The "deauthorize" button is pushed off screen, preventing the user from conveniently deauthorizing the application
####Client settings:
