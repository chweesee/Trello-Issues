####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to the Developer Portal 
- Open the Applications Tab 
- Select an application 
- Change something such as the name. DO NOT SAVE YET 
- On the left, select the dropdown under "Selected App" 
- Select a different application.

####Expected result:
The application selected shouldn't change as long as there's unsaved changes.
####Actual result:
The site shakes like it should, but changes the application in the dropdown.
####Client settings:
Firefox v62.0 (64-bit)
####System settings:
MacBook Pro (13", Mid-2012), macOS 10.13.6
