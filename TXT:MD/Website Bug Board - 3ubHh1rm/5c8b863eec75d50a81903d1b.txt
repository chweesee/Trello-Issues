- Scroll down. 
- Under the "Current Members" heading, observe the box in which the "Admin" text is written.

####Expected result:
It has a line on the right side indicating the right bounds of the box (or the box should be a bit smaller so that it fits in the page).

The box has no right bounds and is excessively long.
