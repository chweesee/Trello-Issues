### **My Steps:**
- Select a team that has a Payment Method added and go to the Payout Settings
- From the Dropdown, select a Team that does not have them added
- Since you were jumped to the General Info, click on the Payout Settings Tab again
-> Under rare circumstances, you should be getting this bug.
