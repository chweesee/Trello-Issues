####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to Discord's developer page 
- Create a team 
- Disable 2FA from User Settings in the Discord app 
- Click 'Delete Team' and type in a random code

####Expected result:
When you click 'Delete Team' it should tell you to turn on 2FA or should just allow you to.
####Actual result:
When you type in a random 2FA code an error pops up.
####Client settings:
