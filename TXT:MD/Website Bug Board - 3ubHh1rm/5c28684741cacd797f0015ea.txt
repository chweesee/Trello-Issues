Reported by ginkoid#8888

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to the developer portal 
- Create an application, or go to an existing one 
- Go to the "App Whitelist" panel 
- Enter a non-existent username, and press the enter key 
- The keyboard focus is now not on the username field 
- This problem also occurs if the username does exist, but this isn't as much of an issue

####Expected result:
The keyboard focus should be back on the username field
####Actual result:
The keyboard focus is not on anything
####Client settings:
The developer portal doesn't have a version in the console.... so, just canary the developer portal on 2018-12-29
####System settings:
Windows Home 1809, Discord Canary 30302
