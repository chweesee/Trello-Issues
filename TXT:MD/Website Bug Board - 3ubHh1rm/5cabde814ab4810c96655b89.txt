Reported by TheForbiddenAi#7549

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to the developer portal 
- Go to an application that is in a team 
- Click check it out 
- Click buy 
- Enter in a TEST card number, expiration date, cvc, name (Here is a test card number if you need one: 5555555555554444, cvc and expiration can be anything you want it to be as long as its in a valid format and valid meaning 33/12 won't work) 
- Hit next 
- Select a country 

- Enter in an invalid address 
- Hit next 
- Observe the error that pops up 
- NOTE: To be safe I suggest entering a Test card number incase it actually buys it lol

####Expected result:
It shouldn't allow you to hit next with an invalid address or it shouldn't give you that massive error
####Actual result:
A massive error appears on your screen
####Client settings:
Chrome 73
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64 (1809)
