Reported by ginkoid#8888

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have 2FA on 
- Go to the Discord developer portal 
- Click on "teams" on the top bar, and click on "new team" 
- Enter more than 128 characters into the name field, and click "confirm"

####Expected result:
The error should say something like "Must be between 2 and 128 in length. (name)", just like the error when you try to create an application with a long name
####Actual result:
The error says "Oops! You've caught an ultra rare error. This is probably our fault, so please try again or check our status page."
####Client settings:
There's no version in the console, so the canary developer console on 2019-01-29
####System settings:
Windows Home 1809, Chrome Stable 71
