### Can reproduce.
Error in console and page loads infinitely - Make sure you have an app not connected to a team, and one that is, also if you have 2FA on, disable it --- 1) Open the application without a team connected  2) Click under 'Selected App' and choose the app with a team connected to it http://prntscr.com/o7sf4w
