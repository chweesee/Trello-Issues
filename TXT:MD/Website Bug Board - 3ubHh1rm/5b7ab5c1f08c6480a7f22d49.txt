####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to:  canary.discordapp.com and make sure you're not signed in. 
- Hit the "Open Discord in your Browser" button. 
- Create an account, then when a new window pops up to sign in the user, close it. 
- Go back to canary.discordapp.com and make sure you're still signed out. 
- Try creating a new account using the "Open Discord in your Browser" feature.

####Expected result:
We expect it to tell us: "You're being rate limited."
####Actual result:
We see the "You're being rate limited." message, but we also se additional information, most likely used for debugging.
####Client settings:
canary.discordapp.com, Google Chrome 68.0.3440.106
####System settings:
Windows 10 (64-bit), Version: 1803
