Reported by ginkoid#8888

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create (or rename) a team so the name is very long, and doesn't have any characters which linebreaks could be placed on (128 Ws work well) 
- Invite your alt to this team 
- Have your alt accept the team invite (you'll need 2FA on both accounts) 
- Observe the green box that opens once the alt accepts the invite

####Expected result:
Linebreaks should be placed in the middle of the team name
####Actual result:
The team name overflows the box
####Client settings:
Chrome Stable 71
####System settings:
Windows Home 1809
