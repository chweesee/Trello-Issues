[GNOME] If another app is focused while Discord's window is open behind, Discord won't take the focus when you click "Open DiscordCanary" option on the system tray. Happens only if Discord is not fullscreen (https://trello.com/c/UNgcdeXM)

P3: Will eventually be fixed,

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Discord, and make the window non-fullscreen (I CNR when fullscreened)
- Open another app (for example a terminal or a text editor), and focus on it (so that Discord's window is behind) 
- Click on the Discord logo in the system tray 
- Click "Open DiscordCanary"

####Expected result:
Discord window should get focused and brought to the top of the other app
####Actual result:
Discord window stays behind the other app and the other app's window stays focused
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 27140
####System settings:
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (stock GNOME desktop env), 64-bit processor Ryzen 7 2700X
