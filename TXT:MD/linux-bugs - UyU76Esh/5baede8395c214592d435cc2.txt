### Can reproduce.
!systeminfo As the discord team might know, there's a bug on the linux client, which leads to a delayed audio when using DP or HDMI output.

As I found out, that does not happen, when an update is installed and it doesn't matter of throughout the app itself or with an app manager.
I don't know if you maybe already knew it, but I hope it helps you to localize the spring of this annoying bug.

Also, it doesn't happen in the web version of discord.

Or is already a fix in work?

Thanks in advance,
I hope I could help you! ðŸ˜ƒ

EDIT: I just found a temporary fix, I have to close the discord app and delete the 0.0.71 folder in ~/.config/discordcanary/ and when discord restarts it works without problems!
EDIT 2: It's actually enough to remove the installed.json in ~/.config/discordcanary/0.0.71/modules/
since then it also downloads 5 "updates" and then it's fixed.

So maybe you should have a look at what happens when an update is installed. ðŸ˜ƒ
