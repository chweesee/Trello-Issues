####Steps to reproduce:Launch discord 
- Go to an discord invite link for a server you never joined before on the browser 
- it should beam the invite to the app, but at the same time it resizes the app window

####Expected result:
Beam to the app without resizing the app, like on windows
####Actual result:
it beams to the app, but at the same time resizes the app to a smaller window
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.24
####System settings:
