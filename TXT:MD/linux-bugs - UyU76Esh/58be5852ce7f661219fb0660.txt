Reported by CyberRonin#5517

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Try to fullscreen a YouTube video when it's loading -If it doesn't do it on the first go, I found that pausing/playing and trying to toggle fullscreen can get it to reproduce. 

####Expected result:
  The YouTube video properly displaying in fullscreen  

####Actual result:
  Discord froze, so I ended the process. I then deleted `/tmp/discord.sock` for it to work again. After deleting `/tmp/discord.sock` it still remains in the system tray. 
####System settings:
 Linux Mint 18.1 Cinnamon 64-bit Discord Version - Newest Release (non Canary) .deb http://i.imgur.com/idNgmAX.png http://i.imgur.com/eY1b62w.png http://i.imgur.com/Bhn5tDC.png
