####Steps to reproduce:
- Check sound device input gain in your system's audio settings 
- Go into Voice & Video settings in Discord 
- Change input volume 
- Check input gain in system's audio settings again

####Expected result:
Sound device input gain stays the same, Discord sets input volume for itself
####Actual result:
Discord overrides the sound device input gain with its input volume setting

### Instead of changing the input sensitivity of the recording for Discord direct, it changes the Input Device sensitivity. This also leads to the effect that the input device sensitivity always gets changed to the value set in Discord (So 100% by default) if the application gets reloaded/restarted.
