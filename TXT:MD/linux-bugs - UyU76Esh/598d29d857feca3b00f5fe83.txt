####Steps to reproduce:
- Have two monitors 
- Open discord 0.0.1

####Expected result:
Discord update window opens in the center of the primary display
####Actual result:
Window is created in the exact center of both monitors, making the center of the window unreadable. <(http://imgur.com/a/C3r1O>) Coupled with 2987 this is extremely annoying.
####Client settings:
<Discord.tar.gz> 0.0.1
####System settings:
Fedora 25 Gnome
