####Steps to reproduce:
- Open a channel whose messages have an animated emoji visible inside the viewport when you're looking at the most recent message 
- Hold down the button and scroll up so that the emoji is no longer visible 
- Without releasing the button or removing your finger from the TrackPoint, scroll back down to the bottom and keep your TrackPoint angled to scroll downward even though you're at the bottom of the page 
- Observe paused animated emoji

####Expected result:
Animated emojis should play as long as they are visible
####Actual result:
Animated emojis pause until you stop scrolling downward
