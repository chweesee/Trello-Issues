####Steps to reproduce:Install both discord canary and the regular discord 
- open discord canary on ubuntu(or kubuntu in my case) 
- notice the task bar logo will be the regualr one(blue) instead of the canary one(orange)

####Expected result:
The logos to be the same (aka the orange one)
####Actual result:
The task bar uses the regular discord logo(blue) instead of the canary one(orange). NOTE: You must have both the regular version of discord and the canary version of discord installed. Not shure if it will work on other versions of discord!
####Client settings:
Discord canary 0.0.24
####System settings:
Kububtu 17.10 using plasma
