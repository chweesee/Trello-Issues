Reported by mark9064#4401

####Steps to reproduce:Run killall -s TERM DiscordCanary

####Expected result:
Discord exits cleanly
####Actual result:
Discord hangs with multiple grey boxes. I am reporting this as this could be the root cause of crashes under GNOME when trying to quit discord. These crashes give a similar behaviour to what happens when you pass SIGTERM to discord processes.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.024 Build 6581
####System settings:
Linux Mint 17.3/4.2.0-22-generic

### Can reproduce.
Discord Stable 0.0.4 build 13537, openSUSE Tumbleweed 20180410.  About 1/10 times that I close Discord, it tries to restart itself.  Note: SIGTERM is the normal way of closing processes on Linux, so this actually has a chance of happening every time Discord is closed and not just through abnormal methods.
