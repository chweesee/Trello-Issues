####Steps to reproduce:
- Connect Spotify to Discord and make them properly work 
- Listen to a song or whatever it is you listen to 
- Click any of the "links" in the Spotify rich presence 
- See a new instance being opened to the Spotify home screen. At first not related to the other instance, then it suddenly syncs up like Spotify meant it to do.

####Expected result:
I assume it's supposed to open the existing instance on the page.
####Actual result:
A new instance of Spotify is made, and redirects to the Spotify home screen.
