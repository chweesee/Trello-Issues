Reported by GNUGradyn(っ◔◡◔)っ#1882

####Steps to reproduce:
- Start a video call 
- share something on the oppisite monitor 
- etc

####Expected result:
Window is shared
####Actual result:
In the web client, it freezes. In the actual client, it crashes and auto-restarts. It's hard for me to experiment much further then this, beacuse i was video calling via my friend who was part of the 5%, and i was not, so i can only test durring active calls, debug log wont fit in discord message
####Client settings:
tested with web and 0.0.2 client, installed from Arch User Repository
####System settings:
Arch linux, KDE
