### Can reproduce.
Can reproduce to an extent... powertop says that the webcam is being used, but my hardware light begs to differ. / Fedora 27, Canary 0.0.45, Build #9599

### I tested this bug during the Trello Cleanup Event, and I was not able to reproduce this bug as my webcam light has remained off unless I needed it. I used Ubuntu 18.04 LTS on Dell Latitude E5540 with Discord Canary Build 18226.

Because I was not able to reproduce this bug anymore, I am moving it to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-06T03:44:30.548Z
