Reported by Xiazee#7377

####Steps to reproduce:
- Be on an older version 
- Start discord 
- Left click anywhere on the updater dialog that pops up

####Expected result:
Should let you use the dropdown and click the button
####Actual result:
The window disappears when left clicked. It's still possible to bring the window back from task manager. Issue does not happen when clicking with middle mouse button, which lets you press the buttons on Kubuntu atleast.
####Client settings:
When updating to 0.0.3, both from 0.0.1 and 0.0.2
####System settings:
Kubuntu 17.10 (Heard it's also present on KDE Mint)
