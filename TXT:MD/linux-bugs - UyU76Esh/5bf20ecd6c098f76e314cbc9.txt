Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- 1) Open Discord 
- 2) Make sure you enabled "minimize Discord in system tray' in your settings 
- 3) Put Discord in fullscreen 
- 4) Click the tray icon and Quit Discord 
- 5) Reopen Discord. It should be opening directly in fullscreen 
- 6) Now put it in windowed mode (aka non-fullscreen) 
- 7) Close Discord but keep it minimized in system tray 
- 8) Reopen Discord 
- Reapeat steps 6 to 8 as many times as you want

####Expected result:
It should reopen Discord in what you left it off before minimizing to system tray
####Actual result:
It always reopen in fullscreen. This doesn't happen if the first boot of Discord was in non-fullscreen
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.60 (build 28197)
####System settings:
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (stock GNOME desktop env), 64-bit processor Ryzen 7 2700X
