Reported by Jiiro#1337

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Discord 
- Go to User Settings 
- Move around your cursor while your clicking a few times on the left, you'll notice that you're able to drag the settings in a text-like fashion which is unexpected 
- Make sure to test around! It took me a little bit to get it working, but watch the video carefully if you cannot reproduce the first time, it's a certain spot that you have to do, I think

####Expected result:
Settings should not be able to be dragged easily like that
####Actual result:
Text can be easily dragged outside the client saving as a file, otherwise you can just move it around
####Client settings:
