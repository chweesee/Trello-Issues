### Can't reproduce.
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS x64, Discord Canary build 10310, I had an older `discord-undefined` autostart entry from dec 18 2017

### Discord uses a setting which isn't universal. In the file in ~/.config/autostart/ it sets X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled instead of Hidden or deleting the autostart file altogether on disable.

### This bug is still happening to non gnome distros. Several reports in DLinux.
