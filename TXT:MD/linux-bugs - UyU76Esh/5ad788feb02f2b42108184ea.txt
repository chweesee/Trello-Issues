####Steps to reproduce:
- Set Firefox as your default web browser 
- Set another browser as default (such as Chrome) 
- Try to open links in Discord and see them be opened with Firefox 
- Some Desktop Environments have no problem handling this; others will refuse to use the default web browser with Discord and continue to use an old setting

####Expected result:
Discord should be using xdg-open to open links; whatever it is using is not reliable for opening links.
####Actual result:
Discord uses something other than xdg-open to open links which sometimes causes a browser that is not default to be used
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.45 build 13573
####System settings:
Linux Mint 18.3
