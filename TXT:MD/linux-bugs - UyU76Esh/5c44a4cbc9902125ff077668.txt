####Steps to reproduce:-Using Ubuntu 18.04 start Discord -Start a game (I specifically have this happen with Caves of Qud on Steam) -Click Gear to go to User Settings -Click Game Activity -In the green "Now Playing" box type a new name for the game you are currently playing (for Caves of Qud I changed it from 'CavesOfQud Configuration' to 'Caves of Qud') -Shut down the game you are playing -Completely close the Discord app (make sure it's not still running in background) -Reopen Discord and go back to Game Activity -Start the same game again -See that the name in the "Now Playing" box has changed back

####Expected result:
Discord should retain the custom input names of games after restarting the application.
####Actual result:
Discord loses the custom game display name data.
