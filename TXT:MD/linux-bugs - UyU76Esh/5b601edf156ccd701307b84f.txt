Reported by Jiiro#1337

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Discord 
- Force Close Discord (In Linux settings I disabled minimize to tray) 
- Open Discord again after closing 
- Observe, it will go down

####Expected result:
Discord is supposed to stay in same position after being force closed and opened again
####Actual result:
Discord goes down every time I force close and open, none of the apps I own that are based on Electron have the same problem, such as Visual Studio Code
####Client settings:
[BUILD INFO] Release Channel: canary, Build Number: 20243
####System settings:
[SPECIFIC DISTRO AND VERSION] - OS: Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS x86_64
