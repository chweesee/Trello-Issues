Reported by The Synthasist#1063

####Steps to reproduce:
- Step 1 
- Right Click Discord Icon, choose logout -

####Expected result:
You should see discord shutdown and close.
####Actual result:
First attempt, it opens a secondary window, and then relogs you back in. Second attempt to try to shut down discord, and it locks up. Two windows are there. Client is locked up, not possible to shut down, unless I reboot linux or log out of linux session.
####Client settings:
Not sure, all I see is Discord Nitro. Unknown what version this is.
####System settings:
Linux Mint Cinnamon 18.3.

### I was not able to reproduce this bug as of Discord Canary Build 18108. My Discord client shuts down normally without any issues, and it did not lock up in any way or form. I used Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for this bug.

Because I was not able to reproduce this bug, I am moving this to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-03T06:06:26.670Z
