Reported by Psy-Q#3076

####Steps to reproduce:
- Use Plasma desktop environment 
- Choose the default GTK3 theme (Breeze) as GTK theme in Settings -> Application Style 
- Start Firefox, look at any Discord server where scrollbars would appear (chat, userlist or channel list need to be long enough to scroll)

####Expected result:
The style should look roughly the same as with the Electron app (no white vertical lines next to scrollbars, no double scrollbars)
####Actual result:
With a light Breeze color setting and a dark Discord theme setting, light grey vertical lines appear next to all custom scrollbars in Discord. When the page is zoomed out, a second set of scrollbars becomes visible next to the Discord custom ones
####Client settings:
Current web version
####System settings:
Debian 9, Plasma 5.8.4, gtk3-engines-breeze 5.8.4, Firefox 56.0.2.
