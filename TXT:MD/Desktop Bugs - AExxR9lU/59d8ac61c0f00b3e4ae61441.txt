P3: Will get fixed eventually

Reported by NdT3#0717

####Steps to reproduce:
- Ensure that your pending friends list or blocked friends list is empty 
- Go to the empty pending/blocked friend list

####Expected result:
There should be a Wumpus image such as "You can't unblock the Wumpus"
####Actual result:
It shows the normal friends list headings and not the Wumpus picture
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.164 (Build 5478)
####System settings:
