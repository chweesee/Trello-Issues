####Steps to reproduce:
- Select any file (special things happen with images and audio files, but anything works.) 
- In any text channel, send a Spotify playlist link to bring up a Spotify Embed. 
- Drag file and drop over Spotify Embed. 
- Observe. Note that once the drag and drop interface comes up, this no longer happens.

####Expected result:
File is uploaded as usual; nothing happens to the Spotify Embed.
####Actual result:
Drag and drop interface does not show up; Spotify Embed turns dark and stops working; Images will be clipped on top of the embed, while audio files start automatically playing within the embed.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 4820
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro x64
