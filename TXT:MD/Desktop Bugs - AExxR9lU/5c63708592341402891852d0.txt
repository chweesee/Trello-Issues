####Steps to reproduce:
- Click "Add it" link in Game Activity settings page (next to "Not seeing your game?" 
- Select a running application from the dropdown (Try Skype, Steam, Outlook, Firefox, or Chrome) 
- Now the box at the top should be green and say the app name and "Now playing!" 
- Quit Discord, keeping whatever app you chose running 
- Open Discord 
- Return to Game Activity settings page 
- Note that the box has returned to gray and says "No game detected" and "What are you playing?!" 
- Note that the previously chosen app is now listed under Added Games and says "Last played X minutes ago"

####Expected result:
The box should still be green, saying the app name and "Now playing!" even after restarting Discord.
####Actual result:
The box returns to gray as if the previously chosen app is no longer running, even though it is still running.
