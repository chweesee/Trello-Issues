[Archived] When you leave a server through someones mutual servers, it stays no matter how many times you try to leave. (https://trello.com/c/eIB65w35)

P3: Will get fixed eventually

Reported by xizbow#5513

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to someones profile 
- Go to Mutual Servers 
- Right-Click on a server, leave it 
- It stays, presumably.
- Try to leave it again

####Expected result:
When you leave the server through mutuals, it vanishes from the list
####Actual result:
The server remains, and will be like that until the profile is closed and reopened.
####Client settings:
Everything default, except zoomed out once
####System settings:
AMD Radeon RX 460, Windows 10 Home, Creators Update(edited)

### This is no longer possible to do with the redesign of the profiles - Jared on 2018-01-05T19:11:42.919Z


### I can still reproduce this by leaving a server in someone's mutual server list instead of your own because of the redesign. Canary 11055 - Tarek on 2018-02-22T19:28:41.964Z

### Crash is fixed, which was the "bug of a bug". However, the initial bug still has not been fixed. - Jared on 2018-03-21T21:59:34.684Z


### This ticket is still reproducible as of Discord Canary Build 18197 on Windows 10 Pro x64 during the Trello Cleanup Event. However, it no longer crashes but the server will remain. 

I will leave this ticket to be, but it will be edited to be the remaining case.  - Ghoul on 2018-07-06T00:39:31.355Z
