### Can reproduce.
Recreated across two seperate clients with two seperate accounts. First client skipping between "=DG=Accuser" and "=DG=Stealth", second client is skipping between "Full Clan Member-4" and "=DG=Accuser." The Elements changes may give some insight. Could not be recreated by two other users, only currently being recreated on my PC. Windows 10 x64 Pro, Not Anniversary. Resolution 1920x1080. Window size of first client: Unknown, maximized before taking measurements. Window size of second client: 901x653. The actual jump seems to change position based on window height, however. Position also seems to vary with how many people are online, and is not dependent on role placement/roles shown.

### I found out recently that this is caused by a mis-sizing of the window. Specifically, by 1px. Just adjust your window and it'll start working again. - Jared on 2016-12-07T21:30:47.299Z
