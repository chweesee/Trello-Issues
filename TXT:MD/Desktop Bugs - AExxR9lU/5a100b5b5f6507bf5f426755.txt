####Steps to reproduce:
- Load Up Discord Canary 
- Look at online 
- number of friends online is different to how many people is online.

Tells the user how many of his friends are online.
####Actual result:
When looking at the online section using canary, for example says 8 friends online when there is more than 8 friends on.
####Client settings:
