Reported by HarryThorpe#0864

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a server with 2 or more voice channels 
- Set the servers AFK timeout to whatever time you want, to keep things simple set it to 1 min 
- Join another voice channel that is not the AFK channel 
- Sit completely idle and observe.

####Expected result:
Once the idle time is reached, the user should be moved to the AFK channel
####Actual result:
You don't get moved at all - regardless of permissions
####Client settings:
Canary Build 15665
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64 - Version 1709 - Build 16299.431

### I tested this bug during the Trello Cleanup Event more than once by following the reproduction steps. I can still reproduce this bug on Windows 10 Home x64 with Discord Canary Build 18317. I set my AFK timer for one minute, and went idle but I was not moved to my AFK channel. 

This ticket will remain here. - Ghoul on 2018-07-08T04:58:47.818Z
