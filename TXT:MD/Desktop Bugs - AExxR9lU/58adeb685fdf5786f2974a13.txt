####Steps to reproduce: 
- Click inside of the Search box 
- Click the Member List, Pinned or Mute button 

####Expected result:
 Search leaves focus and button works as intended 
####Actual result:
 Search leaves focus and button does not always work (due to how fast/slow you release your mouse click) and false hover info may appear http://i.imgur.com/EY1C4ut.gif
