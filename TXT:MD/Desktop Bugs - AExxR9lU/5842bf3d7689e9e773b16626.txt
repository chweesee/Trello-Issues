### Alright, I can confirm that the overlay doesn't show up on initial launch after a restart. That's definitely a bug.

However, pressing the keybind twice and/or closing out the program and relaunching it, the overlay appears correctly.  I don't have to run GeForce Experience at all.

From what I've seen this is a different issue than what was reported in bug-bounties. - Jared on 2016-12-06T22:15:22.448Z
