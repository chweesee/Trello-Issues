####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a user with a "." in their account name 
- in a message type any string of characters except a single space which will be lost in parsing (examples: "abc", "-") 
- after a line break mention the user (2nd line and further) 
- send the message

####Expected result:
The user mentioned is linked in the usual fashion
####Actual result:
The user's accountname is displayed as if the "@" character were escaped and no link is displayed
