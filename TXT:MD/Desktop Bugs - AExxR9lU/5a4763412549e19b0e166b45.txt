### I checked this ticket during the Trello Clean-up event, however, I am still able to reproduce as of Discord Canary Build 18317 on Windows 10 Home x64 (1803). The tooltip still looks as described in Ene's screenshot for me.

Because of this, I will leave it to be. - Ghoul on 2018-07-08T05:31:54.846Z


### Can reproduce.
Tested on Windows 10 Home 64-bit (1803) with Discord Canary Build 24266
