### can still reproduce on 23554. your test user should not able to receive any DM. that means the test user does not have any other shared servers or your allow sending direct messages from  server members is disabled. if you send the invite directly to DM, clyde will reply with an error. but if you send it from invite to server by r-clicking the user, it will trigger the bug.
