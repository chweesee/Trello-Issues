####Steps to reproduce:First, Launch a game on Xbox, wait at least 20 seconds to do the next step (you must have your Xbox Account connected to your Discord Account) 
- Go to a Server or your Discord Account to see your status 
- Once you're viewing your profile on a Server, click on your Profile and normally you would see what you're playing currently 
- If it doesn't show up, there's on bug 
- If it does show your Xbox Status on Discord launch three different Xbox games make sure to wait at least 20 seconds to go launch a different game for Discord to read what you're playing (make sure to close out of a game after)

####Expected result:
It's suppose to show what you're playing on Xbox as your Discord Status
####Actual result:
It doesn't show I'm playing on Xbox as my status on Discord for awhile. Doesn't show on other devices too.
