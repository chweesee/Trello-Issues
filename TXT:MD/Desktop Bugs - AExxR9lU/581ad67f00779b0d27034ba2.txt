Reported by A Generic Gamer#4775

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Change your nickname or someone elses nickname to something excessively long (make sure there are no spaces).  
- NOTE: The only character I've found that's worked is ﷽, and yes, that is just one character (imagine how long 32 of them are) 
- Observe the horizional scroll line that appears below the typing indicator. 

####Expected result:
 either the name gets cut off or continues on another line. 
####Actual result:
 A horizonal scroll bar appears for the duration of the typing indicator. 
####System settings:
 Latest Canary. 
####Client version:
 Win10 x64 anniversary update.

### Can reproduce.
Can easily be fixed by capping the typing notification area so it doesn't break into multiple lines.

### Can reproduce.
Discord Canary 17937 - Windows 10 x64 v1709 - Still reproducible, also this thing makes chat look really messy because their username becomes excessively long.
