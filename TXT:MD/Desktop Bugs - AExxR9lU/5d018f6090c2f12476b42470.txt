####Steps to reproduce:
- You must be able to view all of the servers on the last page of the discovery menu at once for this to work 
- Go to server discovery 
- Go to the last page in the page list at the bottom of the page 
- Then click on any other page 
- Observe how it does not auto scroll up

####Expected result:
The page should auto scroll up to the top of the list like it normally does when switching between other pages
####Actual result:
You are not scrolled up and stay in the same position
