P2: Fix can wait a while

In the attached photo, I'm sending a ton of custom emojis to Liz, and sending too many will trigger the message saying you can't message the user instead of a character limit message. 

The message appearing depends on the length of the custom emoji name. 

:pengo: will trigger the message at 68 emojis, while 
:pikachu_dancing: will trigger the message at 53 emojis.
