####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to the Games tab 
- Play a YouTube video 
- Pause and play the video to make it focused (else the player won't recognize the keystrokes) 
- press F

####Expected result:
The video is supposed to enter fullscreen mode and keep playing
####Actual result:
The player goes into fullscreen mode for a split second, then exits, then you jump to the top of the page again, and then the video starts over again. Also if you ARE in fullscreen mode and press esc, you exit fullscreen, go to the top, and the video starts over. The same thing also happens when you've started a youtube video and the page gets updated (someone starts/stops playing a game)
