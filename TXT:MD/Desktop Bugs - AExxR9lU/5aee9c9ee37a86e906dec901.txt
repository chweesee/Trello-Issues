####Steps to reproduce:
- Enable Full Alerts in a Server 
- Switch to another program that is NOT Discord OR switch to another Channel/Server 
- ask someone (or wait) to post a message in the Channel you enabled Alerts on but are not looking at 
- ignore the Desktop Alert but do not Dismiss it 
- check the Action Centre

####Expected result:
You should be able to see the Alert in the Action Centre because you have not acted on it
####Actual result:
the Alert vanishes and never reaches the Action Centre
####Client settings:
