Reported by Robin#0610

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open any text channel 
- Use a slash command (/giphy, /tenor...) with any text as argument 
- Move the cursor back in the text (using arrow keys or click)

####Expected result:
The current active search keyword stays the same until you edit the text
####Actual result:
The search changes to match only the characters up to the cursor
####Client settings:
Discord Canary Build 13313
####System settings:
Debian Stretch, Gnome 3 (Also seen on Windows 10 x64)
