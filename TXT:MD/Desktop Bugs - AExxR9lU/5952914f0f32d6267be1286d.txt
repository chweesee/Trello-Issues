####Expected result:
It shows as two lines in the overlay

It prints everything as one line

### Not a bug.  People would be able to put like 5 new lines and make the whole chat blank.  Not a good feature to have. - Shadi Isber on 2017-06-27T20:20:17.084Z


### This has been a marked as Not A Bug for more than a month, so I am archiving this ticket. - Jared on 2017-10-17T21:10:14.395Z
