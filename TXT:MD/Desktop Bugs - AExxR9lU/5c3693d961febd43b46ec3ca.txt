Reported by aditya#1337

####Steps to reproduce:
- Make a bot send an embed 
- Send some gap space, 4-5 messages below the embed 
- Have the bot edit the embed with different text of varying number of lines (length) 
- Observe.

####Expected result:
Client window should move around if needed to maintain view of the edited embed
####Actual result:
Client moves around with no methodology and can sometimes push the client outside of the bounds of the embed (counterintuitive)
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 30652 with App Version: 0.0.226
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home // Build 1809
