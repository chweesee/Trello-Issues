####Steps to reproduce:
- Add an emote 
- edit its name 
- observe Audit Log

####Expected result:
create entry should show the original name of the emote, the name it had after it got created (as it is on android), not the edited name
####Actual result:
create entry shows the edited name
####Client settings:
Canary Build 25434
