### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Pro x64, Release Channel: Canary 16275 | Setup: Played spotify on desktop, was in voice chat on desktop. Tried both ptt and voice activity (both work), played a song continuously (esp with voice activity) and then stopped the time to assure 30 second timer. Both ways were able to reproduce the bug. Potential to break Spotify's ToS.
