Reported by Keons#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Listen to spotify 

- Invite a channel to join 

- In the comment section, send a spoiler with /spoiler or with the formatting brackets, bold, italicize, underline any word, etc. This might take a few tries, at times it will format correctly, but usually it should fail to format properly 

- Send

####Expected result:
Comment should format correctly when the spotify invite is sent
####Actual result:
Usually it would either fail to format any spoilers, bold/italicized/etc. words, or send nothing between the formatting brackets
