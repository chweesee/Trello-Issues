Reported by Alipoodle#5025

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open a lovely game with overlay 
- Open the overlay 
- Pin Chat + Server/Channel list together (So unpin chat from showing) 
- Make the window slightly large. 
- Unpin chat from the server/channel list. 
- Make Chat window small (width), and drag to far right of the screen 
- Pin Chat + Server/Channel list together (Again)

####Expected result:
They join together and the chat window is correctly sized
####Actual result:
They join together and the chat window is incorrectly sized causing the window to assume chat is larger and hide a bit of chat + the pin button.
####Client settings:
