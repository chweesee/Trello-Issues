####Steps to reproduce:
- Click fullscreen 
- The icon for going out of full screen will still show the fullscreen icon.

####Expected result:
Show an icon with arrows pointing in to resemble leaving full screen.
####Actual result:
Shows the full-screen icon with arrows pointing out. (Note: This is a discord glitch and not an apple glitch as other applications can do this fine.)
