### Bug seems to be cross-platform since Ene#0808 and KJP12#3880 could repro on Canary 12159 on both Windows and Ubuntu. Moving to desktop board. - Tarek on 2018-03-17T00:24:32.649Z

### Can reproduce.
iPhone 8, iOS 13.3.1 Public Beta 1, TestFlight 3.1.9 (18591) - This seems to happen if there is more than 60 pages for me. It occurs around page 60 - 61, however, it breaks the ability to use search for maybe 35 - 40 seconds.

### Can reproduce.
iPhone XR iOS 13.3 TestFlight 3.1.9 (18591) currently drops at page 60 but search can drop sooner if the next page button is clicked very very quickly, can cause subsequent searches to drop until app is restarted or sometimes reinstalled
