### No, this ticket is not a dupe of the tickets below.

The android ticket below was about Android handling facebook profile links incorrectly, which was fixed a while ago. Now this is affecting every platform. So it's not a dupe. Facebook probably changed the way IDs for profiles works. - Tarek on 2018-04-21T18:56:07.688Z
