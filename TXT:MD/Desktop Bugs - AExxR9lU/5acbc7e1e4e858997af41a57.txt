####Steps to reproduce:
- Hover over the current text channel name at the top of discord 
- Attempt to highlight channel name

####Expected result:
I believe when hovering over the channel name the cursor should appear as the default triangular cursor as if you click and hold you drag the discord window around
####Actual result:
The text/typing cursor appears making it seem that you may highlight or edit the text channel name when in fact if you click it you drag the discord window around
####Client settings:
Canary Build 13313
####System settings:
Macbook Pro 13" (2017) - macOS High Sierra 10.13.3 (17D47)
