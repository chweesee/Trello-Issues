### Can reproduce.
Have a friend add you to a Group DM with at least one other person that you are not friends with and don't share a server with, then have them both go offline. Only your friend will display the offline icon. Based on this, it's more likely that this is a privacy feature, rather than a bug. Possibly consider showing a '?' symbol inside of gray circle instead of no indicator, and also apply to user icons in the small profile cards and full profiles.
