####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Search and search for a long string of characters 
- Close Search and re-open it 
- Observe the History results and hover over to see the plus sign being overlapped

####Expected result:
Search history results fade at the end where the sign is as it does on White Theme
####Actual result:
Long Search history results don't fade and cause overlap with the plus sign
