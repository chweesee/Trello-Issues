Reported by Tiemen#0107

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Server Settings ->Audit Log 
- Filter by an Action Type (doesn't seem to work with all actions types, so try some different ones then) 
- Expand one of the entries

####Expected result:
The entry gets expended and you can read the changes
####Actual result:
Discord crashes and shows the new crash screen
####Client settings:
Canary 0.0.163 (build 4358)
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro x64 Creators Update (1703)
