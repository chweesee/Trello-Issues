####Steps to reproduce:
- Set your language to French  
- Go to server settings  
- Prune a server  
-  I tried in English Spanish and Italian and it diplays correctly the number of users that will be kicked

####Expected result:
It's supposed to display the number of user before "members whi have not been seen..."
####Actual result:
no number appears
