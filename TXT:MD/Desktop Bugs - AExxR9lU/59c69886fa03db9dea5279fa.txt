####Steps to reproduce: 

- Launch League of Legends 
- Have Overlay enabled

####Expected result:
League client shouldn't crash, and overlay should inject smoothly into the verified game.
####Actual result:
League client bug splat loops until Discord is closed out. Disabling Overlay while the loop occurs does not fix it.
####Client settings:
Desktop Stable 0.0.298
####System settings:
Windows 7
