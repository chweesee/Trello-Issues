Reported by Eagler1997#7990

####Steps to reproduce:
- Search for "your mom" in /tenor 
- see the enlarged modal because a gif escapes it's boundaries

####Expected result:
all gifs should behave and should have a maximum size
####Actual result:
1 gif does not behave and escapes it's boundaries

### This isn't an issue with Discord. It's a problem with tenor because we're using the dimensions they give us. Not a bug. - Jared on 2018-02-28T18:17:31.741Z
