####Steps to reproduce:
- Create two voice channels (e.g. general and away) 
- Set the AFK channel to the away channel from server settings 
- Disable the "Connect" permission for the @everyone role for the away channel 
- Have two or more people join the general voice channel 
- Mute and wait until you time out

####Expected result:
Both users are supposed to stay in the general channel, without being moved to the locked away channel
####Actual result:
The user who timed out will see that they moved to the away channel, but will still be able to talk with the others if they unmute. The glitch will not appear for the other users in the channel
