####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure you log out of discord while you're already on the activity tab. 
- Log into discord 
- Notice that the activity tab will: get/stay stuck loading even if you go to another server and come back, ask you to follow games (even if you already do), or if you exit the asking and do it again~ it will say no new news. 
- Refresh (ctrl+r) or Restart your discord and you will see the activity tab like normal/instantly.

####Expected result:
The activity tab should work smooth and fine upon logging in rather than having to refresh/restart (fully close down) discord to have it load normally.
####Actual result:
Upon logging in and starting up on the activity tab, it will: get stuck loading, ask you to follow games (even if you already do), or if you exit it asking and do it again~ it will say no new news.
####Client settings:
