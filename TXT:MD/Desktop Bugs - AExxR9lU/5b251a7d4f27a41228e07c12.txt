Reported by CustomName#9999

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a friend with a nitro subscription 
- Ensure it is not renewed and let it end 
- Allow the system to automatically change their discim 
- Use the ‚ÄúFind or start a conversation‚Äù feature to search them 
- Observe their discriminator which loads on the feature, this is next to their username 
- When you click on their profile observe their actual discriminator and notice the difference

####Expected result:
Discriminator to match their actual discriminator and be the same discriminator as they have on their profile
####Actual result:
Their discriminator is different from the one shown on their profile, even after a reload, it shows their old discriminator.
####Client settings:
Discord TestFlight 2.3.2 (4760)
