Reported by Jenoki#8148

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Have push to talk enabled in settings 
- Join a voice channel 

####Expected result:
 Upon join, your icon shows no activity (does not go green or hear push to talk bleep sound) 
####Actual result:
 Upon joining, your icon will quickly flash green and make the push to talk sound. No audio from mic seems to be transmitted in this time however. 
####System settings:
 Win 10 x64, discord canary
