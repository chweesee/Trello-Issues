Reported by Tarek#1337

####Steps to reproduce:
- Use Discord Web (PTB or Stable) 
- Find a spoopy link, like from a Trello embed title or a GitHub webhook 
- Click "Yep" on the modal 
- Observe how you for some reason gets put into a channel as /{server_id}/{channel_id}/null then into the activity tab

####Expected result:
The web client should open the link and take you to the website
####Actual result:
It takes me to the library tab on a new browser tab instead of opening the link
####Client settings:
Discord Canary web (24227)
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (1803)
