####Steps to reproduce:
- Go into any DM (didn't tried on server) 
- Send 1x1 pixel image (preferably screenshot) 
- Pin it 
- Go into pinned messages and observe

####Expected result:
It is supposed to be normal pinned 1x1 image message but...
####Actual result:
It actually like cuts half of the message, I will ask any bug hunter to attach screenshot so you can see.
####Client settings:
[BUILD INFO] Release Channel: stable, Build Number: 31316, Version Hash: e0a5fe2fc9fc16fff39b8bf73cc5a9199ea26104
####System settings:
