####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Discord (Canary or Stable, version does not matter) 
- Download and execute "Process Manager" (procmon) 
- Go to "Filter" -> "Filter..." and add this filter: <Image1> 
- Apply filters and scroll to bottom 
- Watch Discord spam RegKeyCreate (Might only appear if you dont have quicktime installed)and get denied: <Image2>

####Expected result:
Discord either gets permission to create the registry key OR stops trying to create it after having its access denied
####Actual result:
Discord does neither get access to create the key NOR stops trying to do so
