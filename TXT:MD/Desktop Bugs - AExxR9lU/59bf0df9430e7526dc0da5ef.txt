[Archived] Filling the message bar with a single character for 1.5 lines causes the top/bottom padding to be broken (https://trello.com/c/IoHgmMjS)

P3: Will get fixed eventually

Reported by Super from NotDiscord™#5419

####Steps to reproduce:
- Click the message bar, in any channel you have the permission to do so 
- Hold shift (or turn on Caps Lock) 
- Hold down any of the letter keys (A, B, C, etc.) 
- Observe the padding when a new line is started

####Expected result:
The top/bottom padding on the message bar will be properly adjusted to accomodate the new line
####Actual result:
The padding remains the same, as if the second line didn't even exist. This fixes itself halfway down the line.
####Client settings:
Discord Stable 0.0.298
