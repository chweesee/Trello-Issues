####Steps to reproduce:Create a discord server 
- create 3 text channels with the exact same name 
- send a message in any channel that mentions all three channels 
- use, for example, general~1, general~2 to mention them 
- check all mentions work and take you to the correct channels 
- edit the message and see that the ~1 thing is gone

####Expected result:
The channels stay mentioned correctly with the correct ~ thing when message is edited
####Actual result:
The ~ thing disappears
####Client settings:
