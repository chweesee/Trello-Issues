Reported by 00500005#5783

####Steps to reproduce:
- Zoom the browser in to an invalid level. For myself on chrome with a 4k display, this was 250%. This may vary. Refresh the page

####Expected result:
Avatars should be rendered as normal with correct sizing
####Actual result:
Avatars are not rendered.
####Client settings:
Browser client [Chrome 58.0.3029.81 (64-bit)]
####System settings:
Linux x86_64 (4.4.0-96-generic)

Dev Notes: The avatars are requested but the ?size param is invalid, causing none of the images to load. Verified that removing the ?size param allows the image to be viewed by the browser (in a separate tab)
