####Steps to reproduce:
- note, You need a screen reader to repro this bug. for windows there are 2 screen readers NVDA (non visual desktop access) which is free or JAWS (job access with speach) which is paid. you can use either one. 
- click on a user to go to the mini profile. 
- press the down arrows a couple of times until you here roles. 
- observe, under the word roles is an unlabeled button. i think that's for adding a role.

####Expected result:
If the button is labeled then NVDA should read the label.
####Actual result:
NVDA just says "button"
