Reported by anonymous kitten#8929

####Steps to reproduce:
- Type a message in the text box that is long enough to increase the text box's height. 
- Increase the width of Discord's window. 
- Notice how even though the text now takes up less height, the box is still the same height as before.

####Expected result:
The text box should reduce its height, as the text no longer needs that much height.
####Actual result:
Text box still retains the taller height.
