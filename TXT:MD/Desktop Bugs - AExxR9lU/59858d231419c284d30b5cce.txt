####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a long list of servers in your server list (goes past your screen and you must scroll down) 
- Create a new server or already have a server you have full access to 
- Move your server to 5th from bottom (only 4 channels below it) 
- Scroll all the way to the bottom of your server list 
- Right click on your server then hover over server settings

####Expected result:
The server settings should fully show
####Actual result:
The last option or two in the server settings is off-screen
####Client settings:
Discord Canary, 0.0.163
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64
