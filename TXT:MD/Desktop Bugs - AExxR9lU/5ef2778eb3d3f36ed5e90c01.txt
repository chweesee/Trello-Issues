Reported by Alipoodle#5025

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a public server & Be on a Account which has a Verified email 
- Go to that server's Settings  
- Hover over the "Public" Server Type option

####Expected result:
There is no Tooltip as the server is already Public + Account's email is Verified.
####Actual result:
Tooltip saying "Please verify your Email first" even though it is.
