Reported by Rage#9991

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to the Nitro tab 
- Click on the 4.99$ option 
- Enter a card with insufficient funds 
- Save that info 
- Observe nothing happens

####Expected result:
It brings you to the beginning saying things went wrong like with the 49.99$ option
####Actual result:
It just doesn't save and won't bring you back either. Also the message that the card was declined appears in the Billing tab instead, if you click "add payment method" you can see the error there if you select credit card
####Client settings:
Canary 23709
####System settings:
Macbook Air, macOS Sierra 10.12.6
