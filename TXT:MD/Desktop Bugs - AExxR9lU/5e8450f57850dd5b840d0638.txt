**Short Description:** Exactly 50 channels in a category causes an Uncaught (in promise) error when viewing the server templates tab
**Steps to reproduce:**
- Create a category
- Set exactly 50 channels (which is the exactly the limit) as a child of the category
- Navigate to the server templates tab within server settings

**Expected Result:** The server templates tab loads and becomes useable.
**Actual Result:** An Uncaught (in promise) is thrown stating "Maximum number of channels in category reached (50)". Whilst this is true since there are 50 channels in a category, this is exactly the limit and should be able to load just fine. The server templates tab also does not load.
**Client Settings:** Discord Canary 56789
**System Settings:** MacBook Pro: macOS Catalina 10.15.3
