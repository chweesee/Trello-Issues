####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a new channel 
- Ensure you only have the 'manage channel permissions' permission in the channel (so not server owner or administrator) 
- Ensure you do not have the Manage Webhooks permission in Server Settings or in the channel 
- Add a permissions override for a user (click plus then select a user) 
- Try to grant the user Manage Webhooks permission 
- It should give you an error saying you cannot deny yourself a permission 
- Try to deny the user Manage Webhooks permission 
- It should also give you the same error 
- Grant yourself the Manage Webhooks permission 
- Grant the user the Manage Webhooks permission 
- It should apply the permission override without any issues

####Expected result:
It should grant/deny the permission override to the user without checking to see if you have the Manage Webhooks permission
####Actual result:
It gives the "You cannot deny yourself a permission" when you try to grant or deny a different user the permission
####Client settings:
Desktop Canary 0.0.161
####System settings:
