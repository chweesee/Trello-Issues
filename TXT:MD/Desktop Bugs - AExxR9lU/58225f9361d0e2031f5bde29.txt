####Steps to reproduce:  I'm not sure the exact condidions required, some work and some do not. 
- In my case I have it maximised to where the window itself is ~1280 by 1440 pixels (rough estimate using the recording softwares rectangle select) 
- I am using the canary client on Arch linux on the Gnome desktop https://youtu.be/S44WTLGBHM8 

####Expected result:
Able to scroll all the way to the bottom. 
####Actual result:
 scrolls to the bottom then instantly goes back to the top.
