Reported by Owehttamy#4679

####Steps to reproduce:
- 1. Turn on 'Game Activity' 
- 2. Select a game to display you're playing 
- 3. Join a server's selected AFK channel 
- 4. Try streaming via 'Game Activity' panel 
- 5. Try streaming via 'Voice Connected' panel (Next to disconnect button)

####Expected result:
Either streaming isn't possible in AFK Channels or Game Activity streaming is possible in AFK
####Actual result:
A contradiction is created because you can't stream via Game Activity but can stream through normal Voice Chat panel
