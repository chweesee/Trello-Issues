####Steps to reproduce:
- Pin a message in a channel 
- Send some messages after the system pin message till the system pin message is out of view (just so you can see that it isn't jumping) 
- Open Search and search "in: {current channel}" 
- Scroll down in Search and find the system pin message 
- Press the Jump button on it

####Expected result:
You jump to the system message and it highlights
####Actual result:
Nothing
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.211, Build 20414
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home 64-bit (v1709)

### Can reproduce.
There were some discussion about it being not related to my ticket because there is now a jump button, I think it might still be related and just an extension in this case but dupe is wrong (sorry about that). MacBook Pro 13" (2016), macOS High Sierra 10.13.6, Discord Canary Build 20433

### Blocked fix by https://trello.com/c/z6nOxuVN/

On that ticket there was no jump button. But now there is one but it does not work. So this is a blocked fix. - Tarek on 2018-08-02T04:18:31.896Z
