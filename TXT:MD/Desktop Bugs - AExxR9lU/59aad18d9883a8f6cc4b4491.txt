####Steps to reproduce:
- take reading permissions from everyone via server config (alternatively set it manually on every channel) 
- have someone without roles verify the screen they see

####Expected result:
The "you find yourself in a strange place, you don't have access to any text channels or there are none on this server
####Actual result:
you see the channel invite leads to, can view the memberlist but don't see any messages
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.163 (Build 3838)
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64 v1703
