Reported by Azrael#9495

####Steps to reproduce:
- Be in compact mode 
- Find messages with a thin separator between them (ie from two different users, but not too far apart in time) 
- Mouse over the separator until the cursor changes into the text-editing one 
- click on the exact spot you just found

####Expected result:
The cursor shouldn't change into that one
####Actual result:
The cursor does change, and there's a pop-up showing a user profile that's almost outside of the screen bounds
####Client settings:
stable#34340
####System settings:
Win7x64
