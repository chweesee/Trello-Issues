Reported by desu#6096

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open System Preferences 
- Open "Users & Groups" 
- Click "Login Items" 
- Add Discord 
- Check "Hide" next to Discord 
- Reboot 
- Notice that Discord still pops up during login

####Expected result:
Discord should open at login, but hidden, and should remain so until clicked.
####Actual result:
Discord pops up after rebooting, instead of opening silently in the background.
