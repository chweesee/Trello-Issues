We've received many reports that while speaking in Voice and having Attenuation enabled, the system volume levels are permanently reduced. I.E if you have attenuation set to 50% and system volume at 100%, you end a call in Discord, go to play a New Kids on the Block music video on YouTube and it plays at 50%.

QA has repeatedly tried to reproduce this issue with no luck.

### Can reproduce.
Steps to reproduce on Windows 10: - Set attenuation to a noticeable value (e.g. 80%) - Open the Windows volume mixer and keep it visible  - Join a channel where *other* users speak. When they speak, the volume of other programs should go down; when they stop speaking, the volume should go back up to their original level. - Finally, **disconnect** from voice chat *while another user is speaking*. Expected Result: All other software volumes should go back to their original values. Actual Result: Other software volumes remain unchanged, i.e. stay at -80% attenuation. Reconnecting to the voice chat does not resolve this problem.
