Reported by MrStefan#0001

####Steps to reproduce:Create a category 
- Create a new channel in that category 
- Change the permissions of the channel to make it not sync with the category 
- Assign a role to someone with the permissions "manage roles" but not "manage channels" 
- Change the permissions in the category 
- Try to sync the permissions of the channel with the category

####Expected result:
It should sync the permissions with the catagory
####Actual result:
When you try to sync the permissions, nothing happens, and the button will stay the same, and doesn't say "synced with."

### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Home x64 v1803; Canary 33633; Manage Roles lets you only edit the single channel's permissions and Manage Channels is needed to sync the permissions from the category. One workaround is to give yourself Manage Channel in the channel you are trying to sync.
