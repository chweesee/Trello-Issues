####Steps to reproduce:

- Make sure Discord already asked one time for your microphone or camera permission 
- Go to your System Settings 
- Open Security & Privacy 
- Go to Privacy 
- Remove the permission to access your microphone or camera 
- Go back to Discord and join any voice channel or start a video call 
- Observe it

####Expected result:
Discord should ask a second time for the camera and microphone permissions.
####Actual result:
It only asks one time for the permissions. If you join a voice channel, you will also see the warning that Discord is not detecting any input from your mic.
####Client settings:
Canary Build 25439
