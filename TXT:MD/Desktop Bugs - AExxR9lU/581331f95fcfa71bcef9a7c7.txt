Reported by dinos#0649

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Join/Create a guild with a long name (maybe exploit?) [in the attachment below, the unicode chars used to get the results are U+115F and U+FFFD] 
- Add some spicy emotes to the guild 
- Click on the emoji picker 

####Expected result:
 The guild name is trimmed or its actual length is somehow reduced 
####Actual result:
 The whole name is used in the picker, which results in it having an extremely large width

### It doesn't "break it", it just resizes to fit the longer name while it's visible.
