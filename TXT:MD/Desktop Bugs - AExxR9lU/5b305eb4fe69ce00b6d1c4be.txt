####Steps to reproduce:
- Be using any Chat Font Scaling besides default (100) 
- Go into a channel with enough messages to scroll up in 
- Go into your User Settings > Language 
- Switch to another language then exit your User Settings and observe your scrolled position compared to before (Note: This may take 2-3 tries, it doesn't always occur for some reason, but switching between two languages a few times should show results as the scroll effect stacks)

####Expected result:
Your current scrolled position is kept in place
####Actual result:
You get scrolled up in chat a little every time you change your client language
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.211, Build 17580
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home 64-bit (v1709)
