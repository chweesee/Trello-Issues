####Steps to reproduce:
- In a screenshare-enabled server, have someone (or your alt) screensharing in one of the voice channels. It should have the video icon 
- Make sure you are not in the call, and collapse the category with that screenshared video channel. Observe.

####Expected result:
When you collapse them, the video icon should still be present, as it's still a screenshared voice channel.
####Actual result:
When you collapse the category, the video icon turns into a voice icon.
