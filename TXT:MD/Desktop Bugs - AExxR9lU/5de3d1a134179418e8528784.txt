####Steps to reproduce:
- Restart Discord (Necessary). 
- Go to any Server and to a channel which you want to Follow, press follow and choose where you want to see it and then click Follow. 
- Go to that channel where you followed the other channel and you should see the "Most Important updates will show up here" message. 
- Click the Bold text which says the channel name and observe the box which appears.

####Expected result:
The entire Server Box should show up properly.
####Actual result:
The box is 1/4th cut and only the half of "View Server" icon is seen. (Happens only the first time.)
