Reported by Ene#0808

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open the Invite modal of a server 
- Go into Edit invite link 
- Press the Generate a New Link button 
- Exit the modal and go into the server's Audit Logs to observe the two exact same log entries

####Expected result:
Either the button isn't able to be pressed unless you've changed one of the durations or pressing it doesn't generate a pointless Audit Log entry
####Actual result:
A duplicate Audit Log entry for the already created invite is made every time you press the button without having made any changes
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.211, Build 18317
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home 64-bit (v1709)
