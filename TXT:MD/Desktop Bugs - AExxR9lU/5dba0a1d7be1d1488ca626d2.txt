Reported by Goldenclaw112#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a message towards the top of the screen by the channel name/topic bar 
- Edit that message to include any channel name

####Expected result:
If the box with the matching channel names doesn't fit at the top of the screen, it will be placed below the message
####Actual result:
No matter the height of the matching channel name box, it will always display above the message, even if it doesn't fit.
