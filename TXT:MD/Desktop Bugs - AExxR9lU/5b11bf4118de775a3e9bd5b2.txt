####Steps to reproduce:
- Get a invite to DM link. 
- Send the link to a friend (Bob). 
- Bob joins with the link. Tell Bob to keep looking at the chat room. 
- After Bob has joined, remove him from group.

####Expected result:
Bob sees the same name he sees before joining and getting kicked and a green join button.
####Actual result:
Bob sees the group name has changed to "Unnamed". Green button still works. This works on two computers, two accounts. It should be supported.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 16354
####System settings:
