Reported by Tiemen#0107

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Go into a server where you have both Manage Roles and Manage Channels permissions 
- Go to a channel's permissions 
- Now click out of it and go to a different server where you only have the Manage Channels permissions, but not Manage Roles 
- Go to a channel's settings in that server 
- See what happens 

####Expected result:
 You can't view the channel permissions 
####Actual result:
 Once you open the channel settings the page defaults to its permissions, even if you don't have the Manage Roles permission 
####System settings:
 Windows 10 Pro x64 Anniversary Update, Canary build 17316
