### What about if you select experimental audio subsystem? - Jozsef Vass on 2018-06-12T23:40:53.867Z


### @jozsefvass2 That works fine. But sometimes people experience static noise. So people avoid it. - Tarek on 2018-06-13T03:25:42.816Z


### Thank you @tarek1337. Do you loose audio on stable as well? We did not change standard/legacy audio processing. As for the static noise with experimental, could you please try latest canary, @benmorse9 made several fixes. - Jozsef Vass on 2018-06-13T14:01:20.236Z


### @jozsefvass2 Hmmm.

Stable/ptb works fine with legacy & standard audio. But on Canary it's complete silence. I haven't noticed much static noise from experimental though. This is latest stable & canary. - Tarek on 2018-06-13T14:34:47.641Z


### Hi @tarek1337, could you please try one thing. After switching back to stable, can you select input/output devices and see whether it is still silent. - Jozsef Vass on 2018-06-14T18:21:13.743Z


### @jozsefvass2 Hmm... After joining voice on canary using standard with default setting. Then while being inside that voice channel. I changed the output device to my speakers so I got audio all the sudden. And now standard works completely using default. It's really weird.

So it's something with the default mode doing it.
So to sum it up. The way it worked for me is:

 - Join a voice channel with experimental + default device selected as output.
 - Expect no audio
 - Go to Voice & Video settings
 - Select your output device to your speakers rather than "Default" mode.
 - And all the sudden you have sound, even if you switch back to default. - Tarek on 2018-06-15T00:23:36.078Z
