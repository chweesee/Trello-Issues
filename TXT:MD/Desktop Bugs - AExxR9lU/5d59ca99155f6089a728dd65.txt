Reported by JohnyTheCarrot#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Know of an unavailable Discord server that's in the discovery section.

- Click view

- Wait for the guild to become available

- When the guild becomes available, the client will think it's a normal guild and add it to the server list not as a lurking server but as an actual server

- However, the server will still be like a lurking server it'll just be in the server list

####Expected result:
Once the server becomes available, it should go to the lurking position.
####Actual result:
It joins the other servers as a normal, non-lurking server. This breaks the client when the user is in 100+ servers.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 43884
####System settings:
