####Steps to reproduce:
- First, go into any Discord server. 
- Find any player in the player list on the right. 
- Left click their name in the server so you get their player card. 
- Scroll over to their username, and highlight the whole username (name and #) by left clicking it twice with your mouse. 
- Once highlighted, press "Command" and "C" to copy the highlighted text. 
- Once copied, go into the chat bar and press "Command" and "V" to paste it. 
- You'll see that instead of only copying the user's username, you copied everything that was present in the user's card, i.e. their roles, what game they were playing.

####Expected result:
You're only supposed to copy and paste their username, nothing else.
####Actual result:
When you only want to copy their username, you end up copying everything.
