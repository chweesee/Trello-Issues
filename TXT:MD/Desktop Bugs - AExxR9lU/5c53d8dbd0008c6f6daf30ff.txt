####Steps to reproduce:
- Click the server discovery icon 
- Go to a server with voice channels (I used GTA) 
- Observe how there is voice channels that are clickable but does nothing, but there is also an invite button that just opens up an empty invite box

####Expected result:
There shouldn't be any voice channels that can be seen, or they shouldn't be clickable. You shouldn't be able to click the invite people button either besides the channel
####Actual result:
There is voice channels that are clickable but does nothing, also you can open the invite modal
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.230 (31700)
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (1809)
