Reported by DeadPhoenix#8091

####Steps to reproduce:
- Upload any .m4a file anywhere on discord (sample files can be found on google) 
- Download the file with a recent chromium browser 
- note that many servers report the wrong mimetype and thus trigger this behavior, slack for example does report the correct mimetype and does not have this bug

####Expected result:
The file is supposed to download with the m4a extension. (Content-Type Header audio/mp4)
####Actual result:
The file downloads with the mp3 extension. (Content-Type Header audio/mpeg)
####Client settings:
Discord Web
####System settings:
Version 77.0.3865.120 (Offizieller Build) (64-Bit) - Reproducible on Chromium on Linux aswell
