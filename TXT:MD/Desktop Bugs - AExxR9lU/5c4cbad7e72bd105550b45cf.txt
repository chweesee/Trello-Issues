####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure Discord's website does not have mic permissions on Edge (Settings > Advanced > Website Permissions > Manage Permissions) 

- Open Discord on Edge 

- Attempt to unmute mic without being in a voice channel 

- Observe, if it works as usual then hit the x on granting permission and attempt unmuting while in a voice channel 

- Appears to happen randomly, sometimes when you're in voice chat it won't work and sometimes when you're not in a voice chat it won't work
 
- If you can not reproduce on the first attempt, reassure that permissions have been wiped on Edge and refresh the page to try again

####Expected result:
Discord should prompt an Edge popup to appear asking for the website to have mic permissions.
####Actual result:
Discord's grant mic permission popup appears very briefly, and then disappears. The Edge popup does not appear, and Discord says failed to grant permission for mic.
