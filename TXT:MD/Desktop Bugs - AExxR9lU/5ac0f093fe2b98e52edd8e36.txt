Reported by Krystaldig37#0554

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go on a server you have manage permissions 
- Click on any bot with a role created by itself on join 
- In the mini profile, hover on the application role and you should see the button to remove the role from the user

####Expected result:
You should not see the remove "X", like you can't remove roles
####Actual result:
You see the cross mark on the role tag
