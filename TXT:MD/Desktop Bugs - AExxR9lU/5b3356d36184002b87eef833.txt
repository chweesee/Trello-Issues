Reported by Ene#0808

####Steps to reproduce:
- Copy the link to a message in a channel & post it into the text field 
- Change the message ID at the end of the link to "0" 
- Post it and click on it (Try this a few times in different channels if it doesn't work the first time) 
- Additionally, after having followed the steps, if the link is still visible after jumping and messages were seen to disappear (this occurs mostly if the channel hasn't received any new messages for a week or so), then you can delete the message link to have the effect be permanent

####Expected result:
You're taken to the bottom of the channel that the link is from or it doesn't work at all
####Actual result:
Your client jumps back in history, causing all messages below where it jumped to to disappear until your client is restarted. However, if the additional step was done, restarting will not fix this and it will permanently affect you and everyone else across all platforms
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.211, Build 17800
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home 64-bit (v1709)

### That doesn't works in Group DMS and if you got the URL with the original message id at the end of the link, the message(s) backs

### Idk what Doges did, But I can repro this in DMs, Group DMs and reg text channels. 

This is a very severe bug in my opinion, people can mess up servers with this. It should already be fixed though in the backend. 
Just to clarify, it just have to be deployed. AFAIK. So this bug is still reproducible. The permanent step is a lower chance to get it to happen.  

Though Ene said they'll update the ticket if they find better steps.

I told Ene to submit for archiving purposes. - Tarek on 2018-06-27T09:59:19.229Z

### Just to clarify bit, the server-side issue has been fixed now. But the client bug is still there (aka the client getting in a weird state) - Tarek on 2018-07-06T03:50:57.284Z
