Reported by Pascal#0929

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create or have a voice channel 
- Deny the permission to view the channel for the `@‚Äãeveryone` role 
- Make sure you are using the `View channel` and not the `Connect` permission 
- Observe the channel icon

####Expected result:
The voice channel should have a lock icon because the `@everyone` role can't view it and you need certain roles/permission to view
####Actual result:
Nothing is shown, it looks like a normal voice channel.
