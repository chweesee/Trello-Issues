Reported by ùì∂ùìºùì¨#3261

####Steps to reproduce:
- Send a link to a site with opengraph metadata that has `&lt;foo bar&gt;` or `<foo bar>`

####Expected result:
The embedded information should display `<foo bar>`. It should not be (and is not) treated as html tags, but be displayed as **literal text**.
####Actual result:
The text is **not displayed** at all.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary Build 12217
####System settings:
Win10 x64
