####Steps to reproduce:
- On any channel that you have permission to create an invite, click on the invite icon. 
- You should be led to the invite screen, with the option to copy the link. 
- Press that button multiple times. However, make sure you are only clicking once every time you are clicking it. (You need to try a fair amount of times for this to work). 
- Observe the copy.

####Expected result:
One click, it should copy, and another click, it should "un-copy" (?).
####Actual result:
If you click it enough times, you will see that when you click once, it will copy AND un-copy in one click.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 27964
####System settings:
