####Steps to reproduce:
- join an LFG chat 
- have someone spam the chat 
- click the group message that shows up on your IOS device (only iPhones get this notification and it will disappear within a couple seconds, see attached picture for what this will look like) 
- once clicked, you will be able to see the LFG group chat on your phone 
- click the "join call" button 
- click the video calling button 
- once your video feed is on, others will be able to turn it on aswell using the following steps: 
- open the LFG chat on desktop while someone else has the video call active 
- click on another chat and you should be able to see the small version of the video feed in the corner of your screen (see attached image) 
- hover over the video feed and you should be able to see the screen share and turn on video feed options

####Expected result:
No Video Feeds in LFG
####Actual result:
everyone in the LFG will be able to turn on video feed
