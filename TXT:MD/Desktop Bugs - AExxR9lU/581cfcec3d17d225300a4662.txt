### Verified.  I'm only seeing two though.  If it kept going past that, I could see us fixing that. But if it's just two, this is a Won't Fix. - Jared on 2016-11-08T21:09:39.166Z

### This ticket should be reopened. The first update for today triggered a new icon, so I didn't think anything of it. But the second update added a third icon into Windows, so this needs to be examined as an obvious bug. Please check bug-hunter-general for a pic I uploaded demonstrating this.
