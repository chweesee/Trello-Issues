Reported by PiPinecone#9731

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to activity (so above friends, nitro and library) 
- Navigate to the "Recently played" section where it should show what your friends have been playing lately 
- hover over and click one game with 1+ friends that have been playing it recently 
- it should show the list of friends 
- click on one of those users to show their profile 
- click in the EXACT SAME SPOT you previously clicked to exit the profile 
- attempt to hide the user list by clicking the game with users section once again

####Expected result:
The list of users should disappear.
####Actual result:
When the game is clicked again, it won't close like it does if you click again without navigating through users there.
####Client settings:
Mac Os Canary 48345
####System settings:
MacOS 10.15.1, Macbook pro mid-2012 13-inch
