[Archived] Scrolling does not work properly using scroll wheel in DM channels. When you try to scroll earlier into a channel (from the bottom) the scroll bar will keep moving back to the bottom of the channel a couple times until it eventually works. (https://trello.com/c/znNyGEbG)

P3: Will get fixed eventually,
