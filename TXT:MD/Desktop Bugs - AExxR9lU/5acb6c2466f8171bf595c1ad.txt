####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a server. 
- Do some logged actions (create role for example). 
- Look to the server logs: your actions should appear. 
- Look on the filter by user menu. 
- After, invite someone on thee server and redo the previous steps.

####Expected result:
you should appear on the list when you're the only user and when you're two on it.

You doesn't appear on the menu first, then after someone else joined, you'll appear.
####Client settings:
