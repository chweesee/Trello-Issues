####Steps to reproduce:Two audio output devices are needed for this (referred to as device A and device B) 
- Set device A as default output device. 
- Set Discord's output to default. 
- Verify voice chat from device A. 
- Set device B as default output device. 
- Reconnect to voice server. 
- Verify voice chat is still from device A. 
- Disable device A. 
- Verify loss of voice output.

####Expected result:
As soon as device B is set to default, Discord should switch audio to device B. Failing that, it should at least update when the device is explicitly disabled.
####Actual result:
As noted in steps: At no point does Discord switch to the new default sound device, even when the device it is using is disabled by Windows.
####Client settings:
Desktop Canary 0.0.163
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro v1703 (Build 15063.413)

### Feature request at the moment, not a bug. You're able to switch to the new default sound device by refreshing the app.  - Clayton on 2017-08-09T21:16:39.369Z
