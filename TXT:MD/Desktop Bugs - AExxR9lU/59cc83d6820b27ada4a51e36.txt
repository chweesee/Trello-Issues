[Archived] Discord detects the Acute Accent (U+00B4, `´`) character as a slash character and Diaresis (U+00A8, `¨`) (using Czech keyboard, press `\` on English keyboard) as a backslash character in keybinds (https://trello.com/c/uRz6Xi5h)

P3: Will get fixed eventually

Reported by TTtie#4900

####Steps to reproduce:
- Get a keyboard layout that does has the acute accent character on it (In this report, I'll use the Czech one) 
- Press CTRL + ´ (on Czech keyboard it should be the equal sign character, assuming you have English keyboard) or go to User Settings -> Keybinds -> Add a Keybind, press the record button, and press the aforementioned ´ character.

####Expected result:
The ´ character is not detected as a slash
####Actual result:
The ´ character is detected as a slash, therefore opens the command list when you press CTRL + ´
####Client settings:
Desktop Canary, 0.0.163, build 4923
####System settings:
Windows 10 Creators Update, x64 version
