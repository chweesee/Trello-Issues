####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a news channel you can follow 
- Have a server with enough channels that you can scroll to see them 
- Select that server 
- Open the channel select and scroll to the bottom 
- Observe how when it hits the bottom it just jumps there 
- NOTE: Also happens with the server list if you have enough servers with webhook permissions that you must scroll to see them

####Expected result:
It shouldn't jump
####Actual result:
It jumps
####Client settings:
