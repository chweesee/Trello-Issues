####Steps to reproduce:
- Have both Canary & Stable installed 
- Compare the status context menus on both (Taking a screenshot of one then the other to compare is the easiest way)

####Expected result:
Status context menus should be identical height
####Actual result:
Status context menu has more length between Idle & DnD on Canary since the recent style changes (d1-m9-y18)
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.197, Build 9405
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64
