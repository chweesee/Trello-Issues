####Steps to reproduce:
- Send this link <<http://steamcommunity.com/groups/cheatgiveaways>> anywhere where embeds are allowed. 
- Enjoy that someone's app got crashed

####Expected result:
It shouldn't crash our apps I think.
####Actual result:
Desktop app or browser if we use web-verison freezes for about a 1 minute. Then unfreezes and if you took any actions it shows them happening and freezes again. Rebooting app help to fix app before you look at that embed link again. (putting it in <brackets> won't embed and won't cause that bug)
####Client settings:
Discord Stable 0.0.298
####System settings:
MS Windows 10 Pro x64 Version 1703
