####Steps to reproduce:
- Open up the billing page 
- Click "Add a Payment Method" 
- Enter an invalid credit card number (i.e 111111111111) and notice the error saying something is wrong with the credit card number 
- Enter one of the following invalid numbers "1865258576", "3054052414", "78475108631", "13371337133", "0160330460" â€” All of these numbers are shorter than the minimum card length that Stripe will accept (13 digits).

####Expected result:
The "There is something wrong with your credit card number" message displays, or Discord notifies you that the card was declined by Stripe
####Actual result:
The credit card is falsely considered valid and if you continue adding the payment method, it silently fails at the final step when being declined by Stripe

####System settings:
