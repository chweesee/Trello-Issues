### This bug is WAY off the mark. The bug is since the hex selector is a higher level than the context menu, it overlaps the context menu. The context menu appears in a different place depending on where you clean in the text entry field.

I'm going to edit the bug.  And while verified, it's extremely low priority, probably a Won't Fix. - Jared on 2017-06-12T21:42:05.642Z
