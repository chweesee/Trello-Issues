####Steps to reproduce:start using the mention menu, change the selected item with the arrow keys or by hovering with the mouse, and then close or confirm it. At some later point, open it again.

####Expected result:
When the mention menu is closed and reopened, the selected item should be reset.
####Actual result:
The item in the position you were previously at is selected, rather than the first one.
