####Steps to reproduce:
- not using super fast internet helps 
- reload client to clear caches 
- open the profile of someone you share servers with 
- open the mutual servers tab (try with a few if needed, for some reason some people seem to load realy quickly so you might miss it)

####Expected result:
the loading animation being shown while it is fetching the info (like mutual friends does)
####Actual result:
it shows 'no mutual servers' until it gets the info
####Client settings:
Canary build 9591
####System settings:
Windows 10 1709 x64
