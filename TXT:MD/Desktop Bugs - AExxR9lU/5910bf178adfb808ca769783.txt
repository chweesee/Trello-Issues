Reported by OGNovuh#0014

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Have a user DM you 

####Expected result:
 User's profile picture shows perfectly in the desktop notification 
####Actual result:
  User's profile picture shows as the taskbar icon that is used for what client you are using, Canary, Stable, or PTB **NOTE: This is not a case of a corrupted cache. This has happened to multiple users, and multiple caches can't just corrupt the same way multiple times.** 
####System settings:
 W10 x64 Latest Canary. **ANOTHER NOTE: Only reproducable on W10 versions before the Creators Update, so do not deny if you have the CU**

### This happens with desktop notifications, which are the little bar that pops up on the bottom right of your screen when you get either an @mention or a DM

### Can reproduce.
This has been happening for the past couple of weeks (since about 27th April, when I previously reported). Windows 10 Pro x64 (build 1511, pre Anniversary Update) on Latest Canary build (0.0.154)

### This keeps happening and it's not just with "DM's". Literally any kind of push out notification can randomly fall like this. The attached pictures shows it happening when my bot sends a notification, which clearly has a profile pic, but appears as though it doesn't in the notification.

### This bug continues to happen at random periods of time on the Anniversary Update build (1607). I have noticed this usually happens when you don't receive any desktop notifications for several hours, then receive them again (ie you last receive a notification at 12pm, then get no more until 5pm)

SuperSajuuk#7265 - Bug Bot on 2017-07-04T14:19:49.039Z


### This bug is occurring at once every day and it's quite annoying. It's reached the point where I pretty much don't bother to restart Canary to fix the broken icons.

SuperSajuuk#7265 - Bug Bot on 2017-07-18T14:45:12.499Z


### Can't reproduce.
CNR, tried with over 75 DMs + 7 different people speaking across 2 guilds. Discord Canary 0.0.158 latest build Windows 10 Pro 64-Bit on Build 1607

### Bug is present in pre AU, AU, Versions 1607 to 1703, and the Creators Update. This is obviously not a bug with Windows, as it is present in 3 versions of their operating system.

### Can reproduce.
CR - Desktop Stable 0.0.298 (Build 3183) - Win 10 Pro x64 v1607
