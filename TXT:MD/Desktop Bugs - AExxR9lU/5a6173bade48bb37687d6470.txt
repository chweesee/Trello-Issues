####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a server that has create invite links enabled. 
- Click on the server name in the top-ish left. 
- Click "Invite People". 
- Press the checkbox marked "Set this link to never expire". 
- This may take one or two tries, if it fails just exit out of the menu and recreate the invite. 
- Watch as your dreams collapse, showing you'll never get your hands on a precious permanent invite link.

####Expected result:
The tick should appear in the checkbox, and modify the link to be permanent the first time, not after multiple tries/spamming.
####Actual result:
The tick appears, then immediately or within 1-2 seconds disappears and does not set the link to never expire.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.185 (build 9640)
####System settings:
MacBook Pro (late 2013), macOS Sierra 10.12.1

### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (Version 1709), Discord Canary (Build 9640). It changes the link to a never-expiring one, but the tick disappears in the checkbox. So the bug in reality is just the tick that disappears in the checkbox - the link that never expires still generates after clicking one time the checkbox.
