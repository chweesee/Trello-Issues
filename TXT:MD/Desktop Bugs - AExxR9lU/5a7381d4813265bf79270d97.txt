This is currently unsupported by the Spotify API and thus not a bug on Discord's part. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2018-02-01T22:30:45.537Z

### Can reproduce.
web version (discord) and linux mint 19 (spotify) - if you enable "pivate session" and change song, it will still count the time until the end of the song, instead of removing the info
