Reported by Scrummer#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open an already read DM 
- With ALT pressed, click on any message (of your chat partner) that the chat is being marked as unread and the users avatar pops up in the sidebar again 
- Reload your client with Ctrl+R/CMD+R

####Expected result:
The sidebar should still have the DM with an unread message in it.
####Actual result:
The DM disappears from the sidebar. But: When you go to the previously marked as unread DM, the message is still unread.
