####Steps to reproduce:
- Open tayne and search for something specific so you have few results and have tayne smaller than usual 
- Try to click within the bottom area that it would extend to if fully expanded to try and escape it

####Expected result:
Tayne is exited out upon clicking in the area it isn't present in
####Actual result:
Tayne acts as if it's fully expanded even when not, making a portion of the bottom unable to be clicked to escape it
####Client settings:

### I don't even understand this bug. But I _think_ it's fixed. Moving to Verified Fixed. - Jared on 2018-03-21T20:49:12.013Z

### The bug is that while tayne is collapsed due to few results, the modal is still fully expanded even though it doesn't show it, and you cannot click to close it in the area where the modal isn't visibly expanded but would otherwise be if it was further expanded due to multiple results showing up. If you look at the screenshot closely you can see that tayne is present in a large area the modal isn't currently expanded in. My apologies if this is difficult to understand.
