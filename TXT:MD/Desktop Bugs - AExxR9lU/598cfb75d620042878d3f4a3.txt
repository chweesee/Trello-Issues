Reported by Chester#2084

####Steps to reproduce:
- On a non-admin user, get audit log access 
- Make a channel said user doesn't have access to 
- As said user, on the audit log, open an entry mentionning the channel they cannot see, right-click on the channel name, click "Jump to channel"

####Expected result:
User should at least not be able to jump to the channel, and maybe not be able to see audit log's infos about channels they aren't part of?
####Actual result:
User can see infos they should maybe not be notified about, and can jump to a channel they cannot access (they can't actually send / see messages posted there, but can see the userlist)
####Client settings:
Web client
####System settings:
Archlinux

### This isn't a very standard use case. The audit log isn't meant to be censored by it's nature. This is a low priority P3. - Jared on 2017-10-17T00:37:22.592Z


### Extension for this issue: Right clicking on the jump to channel for voice chats or categories creates a not existing "ghost" text channel. There shouldn't be such a link at all for voice channels or categories.
