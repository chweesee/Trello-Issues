####Steps to reproduce:
- Have music in the background 
- Start the mic test in settings > Voice & Video 
- Close the mic test 
- Listen to the music now

####Expected result:
It doesn't get lowered, like on other browsers
####Actual result:
The volume gets lowered for some odd reason and stays like that, also creating a weird crackly noise with it
####Client settings:
Web Canary 35301
####System settings:
macOS Mojave 10.14, Safari 13.0
