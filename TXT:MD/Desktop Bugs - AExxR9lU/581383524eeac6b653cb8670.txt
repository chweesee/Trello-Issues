### Can reproduce.
This is still happening a year later. I tested it with iPhone 8 +, iOS 11.2.5 (Beta) and Discord TestFlight 2.2.0 (1910).

### I can reproduce on Windows 10 Pro, x64, Fall Creators Update with Discord Canary Build 9070. Apparently, it is also happening on Canary, instead of just iOS. I think it might happen on Linux as well.. Android would not count for this bug because of the missing feature.
