Reported by Ene#0808

####Steps to reproduce:
- Be using Light Theme (Dark Theme works as well, but it's really hard to notice) 
- Go into your User Settings -> Overlay 
- Scroll down to the Overlay Notification display and set it to one of the side panels, then observe the bottom of the panel

####Expected result:
Panels should be fully coloured in
####Actual result:
A bottom portion of the panels doesn't colour in
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.211, Build 19430
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home 64-bit (v1709)

### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 x64 (1803 Update) - Discord Canary: BUILD 19429 I believe this is a intended feature, a sort of "shadow" effect, but either way, it definitely exists.
