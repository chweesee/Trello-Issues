Reported by Adri√°n#1806

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open discord 
- Click on Listen Along on a user's Spotify on Discord.

####Expected result:
Join a room to listen along music with a user, if he changes the song.
####Actual result:
Spotify plays the song but the room is not created, works just as the "Play on Spotify" button, rather than the Listening Along
