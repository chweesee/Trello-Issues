####Steps to reproduce:
- change to light theme... 
- Do NOT have a server with any ~~VC~~ Custom Status feature 
- Ask someone to turn their Custom Status on if they have any servers with it 
- Tell them to turn off Spotify, or Game status 
- Click on their icon 
- Click on their avatar to get to the profile screen with connections 
- Look at the shading of the bar area with User Info, Mutual Servers, and Mutual Friends tabs.

####Expected result:
The VC Status shading and text is supposed to appear for only people with a VC status server
####Actual result:
The VC Status shading shows for everyone except the VC Status text itself.
