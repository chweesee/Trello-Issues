Reported by Rage#9991

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have Nitro purchased with the monthly option 
- Go to the Billing tab 
- Expand one of the purchases made with the monthly option and that it's refund eligibilty has expired 
- The purchase must be expired, that means you must not have Nitro from that purchase anymore 
- Observe what it says next to "Purchase Date"

####Expected result:
It doesn't show time played since Nitro doesn't have that
####Actual result:
There is a "Time Played" segment, it might not always show, can require multiple purchases to successfully reproduce
####Client settings:
Canary 23837
####System settings:
