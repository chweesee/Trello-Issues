Reported by Rashaun#9295

####Steps to reproduce:
- Write/copy and past a message that ends right before a line break (the next character causes a new line) 
- Without sending the message, switch channels 
- Switch back to the channel you typed the message and view the message box 
- Note: The amount of characters needed differs depending on if you have the member list open or not

####Expected result:
Message box is the same height as when you switched channels
####Actual result:
Message box adds an empty line to the end of the message
####Client settings:
Canary Build 23321
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64 1803
