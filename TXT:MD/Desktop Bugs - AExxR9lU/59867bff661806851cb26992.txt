[Archived] If you block a user and try to jump to their message, it'd say that you cannot jump to their message because they're blocked but if you unblock them and try to jump to their message, it'll still say that they're blocked even though they are not. (https://trello.com/c/ctJxnrHe)

P3: Will get fixed eventually

####Steps to reproduce:Block a user 
- try to jump to their message that they sent 
- if you get a message saying you cannot since they are blocked, unblock them 
- try jumping to their message again

####Expected result:
After unblocking them, it says that they're still blocked even though it should allow you to jump to their message.
####Actual result:
After unblocking the user, it doesn't allow you to jump to their message because it says that they're still blocked even though they are not.
