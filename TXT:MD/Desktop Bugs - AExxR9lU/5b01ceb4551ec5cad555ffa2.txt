The bottom "New" button on the server list scrolls down, but covers the last unread notification instead of disappearing (https://trello.com/c/STQzX2od)

P3: Will get fixed eventually,

Reported by lego#8917

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a long enough list of servers, with one of them having a notification off screen to trigger the "New" button 
- Click the "New" button to scroll the list down

####Expected result:
New button is dismissed once the server with the notification is scrolled into view
####Actual result:
View-port scrolls to the bottom of the list, and then covers the server's notification. The button is still present, and when clicked, does nothing. Scrolling up with the top "New" button does not reproduce.

### Can reproduce.
[CR] Client Settings: Canary Build 15665 System Settings: Windows 10 Home x64 Version 1709 Build 16299.431 - Scrolling down a little after pressing the button makes it disappear, but clicking the button alone causes to remain persistently on top of the servers notification. I have seen this kind of behaviour on Android before, but this is the first I've seen it on Desktop.

### Related issue is denied bug 13067 where scrolling up with the new button also does not dismiss, may be MacOS only.
