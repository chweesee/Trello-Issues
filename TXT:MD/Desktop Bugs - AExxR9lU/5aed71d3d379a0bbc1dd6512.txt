### Verified, but I don't actually think this is a bug. The client is waiting on a response from the server that it was successfully posted, which it never gets and it stops trying to resend because it's being restarted. Afterwards it continues trying to send the message and succeeds as the page is loading.

I'm closing this out as Not A Bug - Jared on 2018-05-08T18:26:27.996Z
