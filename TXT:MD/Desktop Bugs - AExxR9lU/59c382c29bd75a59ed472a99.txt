Reported by Flamanis#7150

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have monitor on 1440x900 resolution 
- Have discord fullscreen on that 
- Enable compact mode on Discord 
- Type in a codeblock, and then an amount of text after it, and it will fail to wordwrap towards the end sometimes 
- My test phrase: This phrase might just run off of the page because it's a bit longer than stuff that gets discord antidisestablishmentarianism display 
- Put that after an empty or even full code block, but on the same line as the \`\`\`

####Expected result:
It wraps antidisestablishmentarianism correctly
####Actual result:
It does not wrap it, and instead a few characters are cut off
####Client settings:
Discord windows desktop client
####System settings:
Win 10 x64
