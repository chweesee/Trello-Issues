####Steps to reproduce:
- Start Guest Mode on any available server. 
- Quit your desktop app if it's open. 
- Go to the Canary homepage. (canary dot <discord domain>) 
- Click "Nitro" at the top of the page. 
- Click any plan.

####Expected result:
I'm not really sure, but it definitely shouldn't just drop you on a blank screen.
####Actual result:
The settings screen opens in the Nitro tab on the web browser app.
####Client settings:
Web Canary 32357 - Safari 12.0.2 (14606.3.4)
####System settings:
