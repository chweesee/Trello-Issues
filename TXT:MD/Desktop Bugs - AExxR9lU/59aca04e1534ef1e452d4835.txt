####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a GIF with 40 ms frames. 
- Make the last frame 2000 ms. 
- Create same GIF but make the last frame 40 ms and repeat it 50 times instead. Ensure that the program doesn't optimise it to a single 2000 ms frame! With Screen To Gif (free tool) you can do this by unchecking "Detect unchanged pixels" when saving. 
- Upload both gifs in a Discord chat. Or upload on imgur or Gfycat and post a link. I think imgur has the same problem, but Gfycat doesn't. 
- In the first GIF the last frame is played as fast as the other frames. The second GIF plays as intended though.

####Expected result:
Discord should take individual frame times into account. If the last frame is 2 s long it should be shown for 2 s.
####Actual result:
If the other frames are 40 ms, the last frame will be shown for 40 ms, even if it is set as 2 s.

####System settings:
