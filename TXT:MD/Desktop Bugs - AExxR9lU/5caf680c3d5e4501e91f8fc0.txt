####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to Settings -> Notifications -> Enable Desktop Notifications 
- Disable this setting 
- Click on some other window and wait for someone to send you a message 
- Realize that you don't get any kind of a warning telling you that you have new messages to read

####Expected result:
The app should start flashing orange in the task bar, like it does when I have notifications enabled.
####Actual result:
The setting disables both the popup and the orange flash. I'd only want to disable the popups.
####Client settings:
Release Channel: stable, Build Number: 35335, Version Hash: 5deec429160a96d27a3aff5c13a48d194d2babbf
####System settings:
Windows 10, have had the same issue for last 2 years so doesn't really matter. Latest: "Windows 10, version 1709 (2)"
