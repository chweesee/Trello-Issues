### Can reproduce.
Can Reproduce - Had this happen to me on Windows 10 x64 v1709 - The client itself just sits blank, as if it can't/isn't loading the web-app, haven't been able to find solid repro steps for this, been messing about a little, seems very random but does occur more often if you're updating from an much older build to a new build. CTRL+R does not fix the issue and usually restarting the app sorts the problem. (Could be a Chromium Issue?)
