[Archived] If @ is the first character of a message, and is deleted, the mention recommendation list is still there, even when you click out and back into the message bar. The same is said for # and the channel list. (https://trello.com/c/7VaoyhHP)

P2: Fix can wait a while

Reported by Zempro#6616

####Steps to reproduce:
- Type "@" or "#" 
- delete "@" or "#" 
- (continuation of bug) click out of message bar 
- click on message bar

####Expected result:
You are given mention recommendations once "@" is typed, or a channel list once "#" is typed. Once the "@" or "#" is deleted, the mention recommendations/channel list disappear.
####Actual result:
You are given mention recommendations once "@" is typed, or a channel list once "#" is typed. Once the "@"/"#" is deleted, the mention/channel list stays there. The mention/channel list still remains if one clicks out of, and back into the message bar. In action (using @): https://gyazo.com/cf3e33c99704df90766dfcc3c30a9fc4 This only happens if "@"/"#" is the first character. Anything before it, it functions normally (ily @ will not have the same result).

### This also happens to the emote list: How to repro

Don't fully write out a emote name, for an example: :pog (instead of pogchamp) then ctrl + a and delete the emote name the list stays
