####Steps to reproduce:
- Connect Xbox One controller 
- Click Settings and go to Keybinds 
- Click Add a Keybind 
- Click "No Keybind Set" and press any button on the Xbox One controller 
- Discord will not recognize the button push and keep recording

####Expected result:
Discord should record the keypress properly. For example, it would read "Gamepad 6" or something similar for an RB press
####Actual result:
No button press is recorded. Nothing happens at all.
