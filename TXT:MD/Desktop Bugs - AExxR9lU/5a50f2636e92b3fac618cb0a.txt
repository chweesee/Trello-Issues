####Steps to reproduce:
- Open a discord screenshare session. 
- CTRL + ALT + DEL 
- Click "Switch User" 
- Login to another user (Not sure if its due to me logging into another domain account) 
- Repeat from step 2 except log back into your normal account 
- See

####Expected result:
Resume the call of as normal since you didn't leave the call, or at least rejoin the call instead of restarting discord client.
####Actual result:
The call you are in is frozen, one way communication, the other end can hear you. You can rejoin the call but once you start to screenshare again you get a endless black loading screen until you restart Discord Client and it will work again.
####Client settings:
Release Channel: stable, Build Number: 9072, Version Hash: f546e8dff486ff50228e2ae54d8502fbfc9ba766
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro Version 1709 [Build: 16299.125]

### Can reproduce.
Sort of CR. Windows 10 Pro x64 Fall Creators Update, Discord Canary Build 9193. | What happens for me is that the call does not freeze, but Discord window does seems to wonk out by being sized in a weird way, and then re-snapping itself. After I hung up in the call and re-called with screen-sharing, there is just the black pitch of screen with endless loading.
