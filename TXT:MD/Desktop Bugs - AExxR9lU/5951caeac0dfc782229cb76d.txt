### Checked as of latest canary:

I can no longer reproduce this myself. Fullscreening it works just fine, which means it got released in the last canary update.

As per Dabbit's new "you can move stuff into claimed fixed" thingy, I'm movin' it. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-06-30T23:27:17.621Z

### Partially fixed, opening fullscreen while in a servfer, closing shows a broken text channels list.
