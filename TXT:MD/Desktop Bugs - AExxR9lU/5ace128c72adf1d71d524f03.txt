####Steps to reproduce:
- Get the ID of any emoji that got uploaded to a server you are not a member of 
- Open any channel and go to the channel topic 
- Type `<:EmojiName:EmojiID>` (add `a` at the beginning when it is animated) 
- Save it

####Expected result:
You shouldn't be able to use custom emojis from servers you are not a member of & also not be able to use animated emoji without Discord Nitro
####Actual result:
You can use every custom emoji, also animated ones.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.186 (Build: 13373)
####System settings:
MacBook Pro 13" (2016), macOS High Sierra 10.13.4
