[Archived] When you're making a text-channel and you type some letters and realise you made a mistake, like missed out a space between 1 word and another (which then makes a dash) the rest of the text that you want to type after the space goes back to where your text channel name finishes. (https://trello.com/c/JJnBtIk8)

P3: Will get fixed eventually

Reported by c3vyz#7714

####Steps to reproduce:
- Begin to create a text channel and name it 
- Once you have placed a few characters go back a few characters 
- Hit the spacebar

####Expected result:
The spacebar shouldn't make the text you were going to type after go back to the end of the text-channel name and should allow you to keep typing as normal.
####Actual result:
If you hit the spacebar in between 2 words/characters, the typing indicator goes to back to the last character you typed before you went back to put a space between the other characters. (if needed, I can create a gif showing what happens because I know this is a weird explanation, mainly because it's hard to explain in words... :/
