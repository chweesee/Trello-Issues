### In my testing it seems that right-clicking a server you don't have in focus and going straight to Server Settings > Audit Logs, the filter is empty and just shows "All". However, going to any other section and then clicking into Audit Logs, the filter is populated by admins/mods of the server currently in focus instead of the one you're actually trying to configure.
