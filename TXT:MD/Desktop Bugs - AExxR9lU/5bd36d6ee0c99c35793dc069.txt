Reported by Aeria#9096

####Steps to reproduce:
- Set your language to German 
- Rightclick a server and click on the blurple "Invite People" button ("Leute einladen" is the currently used String) 
- Observe

####Expected result:
The buttons adjust to the actual String-length, so that it is fully readable
####Actual result:
The "Invite" and "Copy" button are cut off and continued by a "...", making it hard to understand what the buttons mean
####Client settings:

####System settings:
