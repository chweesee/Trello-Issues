### It seems to me that you cannot reproduce this by switching between bands on the same network (2.4 ghz/5ghz). You need to connect to a completely different network.

### Can reproduce.
Can repro using hotspot. Slice is right, switching bands or guest to non-guest does not work. It takes a while to disconnect. Used Discord Canary 0.0.153, macOS Sierra 10.12.6 (16G29) (iMac Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2017)
