- use any application u can change name (for example the system which is normally used for custom playing msgs) 
- change the name to a game name like Subnautica or Slime Rancher ect 
- click on ur profile and look at ur playing status

####Expected result:
It should still show the question mark logo unless it is the official game
####Actual result:
your game will be what u typed but the logo will be the right logo and the client will treat it like the acual game
