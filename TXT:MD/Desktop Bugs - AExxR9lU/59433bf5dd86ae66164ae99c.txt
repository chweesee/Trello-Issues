Reported by !A²#6155

####Steps to reproduce:
- Get two offline bots 
- Give one a role. (the color I used was #6FE29D)

####Expected result:
The [ BOT ] tags should be the same color regardless of their roles.
####Actual result:
The [ BOT ] tags have different colors. The on with the role shows as a greyish blue.
####Client settings:
Discord 0.0.157
