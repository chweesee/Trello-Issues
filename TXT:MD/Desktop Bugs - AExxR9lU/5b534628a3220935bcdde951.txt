Reported by Galkon#1337

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to developer panel 
- Create or edit a bot 
- Upload a png avatar
- Watch as it completely wrecks the quality of your image and only renders it as 64x64 everywhere

####Expected result:
It should act the same as it does for a , retain quality / resolution and not look pixelated
####Actual result:
The  with transparency is for whatever reason massively downscaled and never rendered larger than 64x64 by Discord
####Client settings:
Discord Developer Panel - was told to report it in desktop bugs.
####System settings:
Google Chrome Version 67.0.3396.99 (Official Build) (64-bit)

### Edit the steps and title, since transparency and it being 1024x1024 was unrelated.
