### This is still an experiment with 5% of guilds enabled with less than 50 members. - Jozsef Vass on 2018-07-30T15:17:34.011Z


### @jozsefvass2 sorry. This ticket is very unclear.

The bug here is that sometimes when you mention people. Or "tab" into other servers while video calling in a server. The screenshare icon turns into the debug icon. I can personally not reproduce this. - Tarek on 2018-07-30T15:44:05.042Z

Screenshare button disappears for all users but me (the admin) when entering the server. Users can work around this by restarting discord while staying in voicechat, and then NOT entering the server. The screenshare button is visible again by doing this, but it disappears again if they enter the server.
