####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to Server Discovery 
- Click View on any server (Ex: Move or Die) 
- Pick someone on the user list that is not a bot and has a role, then open their full profile 
- Check if you dont have any mutual servers with them 
- Click the menu button next to Send Friend Request to open the menu and select "Message" 
- Attempt to DM them something, it should fail due to no servers in common 
- Go back to Server Discovery and view the same server 
- Open the mini-profile of the user you attempted to DM, it should still display his roles 
- With the mini-profile still open, click Join on the Server Discovery prompt to join the server 
- Watch as the roles of the user you attempted to DM before disappear and Discord treats them as a user that left the server.

####Expected result:
The DM'ed user's roles display as usual
####Actual result:
Their mini-profile displays like the one of someone who left the server. (No roles section/Quick message box)
