Reported by OGaming#7135

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Grab a server (I chose one near the top) 
- Drag it down so your servers start to scroll 
- Drag the server upwards 
- Notice You can't properly move the server anymore unless it's the original spot 

####Expected result:
 It still works and has the dotted circle selection thingy 
####Actual result:
 It just moves the servers without leaving a gap 
####System settings:
 Windows x64, Canary
