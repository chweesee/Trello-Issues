####Steps to reproduce:
- Open 2 text channels with nothing typed in the chat box 
- Create 2+ line breaks (1 works but doesn't show well) 
- Create 1 more line with at least 1 character in it 
- Repeat steps 2 and 3 in a separate channel so they look identical 
- Navigate back to the first text channel and type or delete a character

####Expected result:
The text box should resize so that it fits all of the text and doesn't cut off letting some hang outside.
####Actual result:
The text box should attempt to resize however much was shown on the scroll bar, but leaves the text outside of it.
