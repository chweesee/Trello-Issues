Reported by DaFri_Nochiterov#4289

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have bot that can send and update embeds (in my example it's my own bot Snowball; I can send you link to the testing server, pls DM) 
- Send embed and after some time update it with some fields content 
- Next update push should contain thumbnail or image (?) that wasn't cached on Discord servers yet (?)

####Expected result:
Embed updates absolutely fine
####Actual result:
Content of some fields becomes 'mixed' / 'corrupted' until you re-open channel
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.180, Build 7653
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro 1709 (17035)
