Reported by Keons#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have your Discord set to another language (I used Japanese) 
- Press CTRL+R to reload or restart Discord (as the bug will only work after you have refreshed it)

####Expected result:
The mobile presence indicator should show on users if you're on a different language
####Actual result:
The mobile presence indicator does not show up and you have no way of knowing if someone is on mobile
####Client settings:
Desktop Canary 29619
####System settings:
Windows 10 Education (1809) x64
