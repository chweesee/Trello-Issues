Reported by FSM#0003

####Steps to reproduce:
- Set appearance to a zoom of 67 and a font scaling of 90 
- Change nickname to "A Pink Cow" 
- Seems to work with different letters substituted into name sometimes (certain combinations can replicate, others can't) but cut-off seems to change based on difference in letters used 
- Seen in screenshot

####Expected result:
Name should display clearly with no cutoff.
####Actual result:
"w" slightly cut off in sidebar at the end of name "A Pink Cow" and other names similar in letters of same size.
