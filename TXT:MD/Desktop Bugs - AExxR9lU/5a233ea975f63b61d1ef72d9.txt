### Not related to UK, happening to all languages that uses 24 hours time format, possible dupe of https://trello.com/c/4I8kGuuw. 
But we decided to allow a second ticket since the other ticket has a low priority because it was only happening to Swedish at the time.

Also, every language are forced to use mm/dd/yyyy, instead of dd/mm/yyyy when it should. - Tarek on 2017-12-03T13:25:11.589Z


### Can reproduce.
CR; Windows 7 ultimate x64 Deskop Canary 7963; Timestamps in other languages are also in 12 hour format
