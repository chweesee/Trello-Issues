####Steps to reproduce:
- follow and own game with a long name (PUBG for example) 
- go to the activity tab and click on the game icon from a news post 
- observe how there is no space after the S and before the Play button

####Expected result:
there should be some space separating the game title and the play button
####Actual result:
there is 0 space between the both and the play button is almost overlapped by the last char of the game name

####System settings:
