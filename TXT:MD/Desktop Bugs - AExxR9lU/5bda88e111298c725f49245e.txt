Reported by Hole#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a Voice Channel with the name having 17 characters, and the voice chat limit being 10 users (I used "Pew Pew Game Room). 
- Observe the last letter getting cut (For me, M).

####Expected result:
There should be dots in the voice channel name.
####Actual result:
The M just gets cut (If the channel is anything longer than 17 characters, it will have the dots).
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 27349
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro, x64 (v1803)

### Can reproduce.
Seems to happen with any amount of characters and an emote + 'medical symbol' emote right at the end before it creates dots. User limit doesn't matter either (Shown here: https://i.imgur.com/kl8SgCv.png)  Windows 10 Home (x64) - Canary (36128)
