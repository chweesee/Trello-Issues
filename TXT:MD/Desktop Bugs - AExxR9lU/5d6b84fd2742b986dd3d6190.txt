### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Home x64 v1903 - Discord Canary 0.0.255 Build 44603 - Upon further testing, it appears the issue here is that Discord is trying to stream the RuneScape 3 launcher that's hidden in Task Manager as a background process but not the game itself. To get Discord to stream the game you would have to manually add RuneScape 3 as a game from Game Activity in User Settings after the game has finished loading and prompts you with the login screen.
