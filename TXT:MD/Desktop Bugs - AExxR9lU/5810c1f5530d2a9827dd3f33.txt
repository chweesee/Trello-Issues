### I don't understand why you would need a typing indicator for yourself.  One would assume that you'd know when you're typing or not. - Jared on 2016-10-26T15:52:45.471Z


### Regardless, minor issue that I don't think we're going to get around to fixing.  Moving to Won't Fix. - Jared on 2016-10-26T15:53:37.934Z


### Moved from User Reported Bugs to Won't Fix. Dead Bug by Jared on 2016-10-26T15:53:43.292Z
