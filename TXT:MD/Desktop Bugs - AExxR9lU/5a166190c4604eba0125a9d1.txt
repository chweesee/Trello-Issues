Reported by Incineroar#7794

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a computer with a touchscreen (Slightly necessary) 
- Open Discord to absolutely any page 
- Zoom using Ctrl +/
- () 
- Zoom using a pinching gesture ()

####Expected result:
Either the pinch-to-zoom should follow Ctrl +/- or should completely be disabled.
####Actual result:
The Ctrl +/- does a proper zoom, while pinching enlarges everything without respect to window size. See screens above. Additionally, pinch-zooming can hide the window title bar.
####Client settings:

### Can reproduce.
Generic can repro this but isn't responding to DMs for some reason, so I'm approving it for him.
