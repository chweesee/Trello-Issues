- Find a channel with "Unread" messages in it (more messages makes it easier to see) 
- Scroll down to the bottom of the chat (Pin the chat if you haven't already) 
- Close overlay

####Expected result:
You should stay at the bottom of the channel so you can read any new messages
####Actual result:
It scrolls back up to the unread message!
