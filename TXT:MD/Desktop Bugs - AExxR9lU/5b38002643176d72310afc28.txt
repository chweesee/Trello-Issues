### Can reproduce.
Can reproduce on Windows 10 Home x64 (Version 1803), Discord Canary Build 18044. The image that's being shown is that on the left, it is from the DMs. But on the right, is from the server. The reporter is talking about how the ⋮  menu is in a different size in the DMs rather than the server.
