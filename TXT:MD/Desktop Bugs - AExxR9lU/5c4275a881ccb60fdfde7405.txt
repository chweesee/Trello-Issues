####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a Discord server that allows you to upload embeds or DMs 
- Go to Spotify and start listening to a song that has a long title 
- Now make a Spotify embed 
- If possible, pin it, or try to delete your message to get the delete modal open 
- If you pinned it, you will be able to see that you can interact with the embed 
- If you try to delete and get into the delete modal, you will see that you are able to interact with the embed 
- If one of your friends is in the server or DM with you, make them check out the pins and they can try joining

####Expected result:
You are not able to interact with an embed whilst you are in the delete modal or the pins.
####Actual result:
You are able to interact with an embed whilst you are in the delete modal or the pins.
