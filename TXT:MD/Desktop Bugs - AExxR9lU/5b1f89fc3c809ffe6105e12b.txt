Reported by Tarek#1337

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to server settings 
- Go to members 
- Try to assign a role by using the plus button, not the right click menu

####Expected result:
It supposed to instantly update name color and the roles column
####Actual result:
Nothing, it doesn't update as if you haven't given them a role. Until you right click on them, then it appears
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.210 (16727)
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (1803)

### Can reproduce.
Can reproduce. It took me a little bit. Attached image happens. This also happens when trying to remove the role when you click the X in front of the role name, you have to right click it to have the list show that its been removed. Windows 10 x64, Canary 16727

### Can reproduce.
The issue only seems to occur when the target member isn't cached by the client. To reproduce it, go to a larger server (200+ members) and edit the roles of a member who a) is offline, b) isn't visible in the member list without scrolling, c) whose profile you haven't opened yet and d) whose profile isn't in any other way cached by your client. An ideal candidate is someone who hasn't been online in a long time and whose username is at the bottom of the member list. If you then edit his roles the update isn't reflected immediately. If the member is cached already, for example because he's online and near the top of the member list, the role update is reflected immediately.
