Reported by üéÅ FireController1847#9085

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Find a server without the user in it. 
- Tag the user in that server using ID's. 
- Edit the message. 

####Expected result:
 Either it removed the UUID after the user's name, or keeps the tag. 
####Actual result:
 It replaces it with tagging a role (if a role is the same name), or the user's name and discrim.
