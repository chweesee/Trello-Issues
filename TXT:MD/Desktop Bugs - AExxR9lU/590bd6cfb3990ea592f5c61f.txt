####Steps to reproduce: 
- Edit a non-default text channel 
- Go to the Invites page and use the create link 
- Dismiss the invite link box 
- Note that the created invite is visible in the invites list 
- Leave and re-enter the channel's settings 
- Note that the created invite is now missing on the Invites page 
- Access the Invites page under Server settings 
- Note that the created invite belongs to the default channel 

####Expected result:
 The invite should point to the channel you edited (like those created via the quick invite button) 
####Actual result:
 The invite points to the default channel 
####System settings:

### I can repro this with steps provided from Ene:

 - Create two channels
 - Be in/view channel #1
 - Go into channel 2's channel settings invite section
 - Click on "Create one" to open the invite modal
 - Exit the channel settings page
 - Open audit logs and observe that the invite was not created for the channel you selected
