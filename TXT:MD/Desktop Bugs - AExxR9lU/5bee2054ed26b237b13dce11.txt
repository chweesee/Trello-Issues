####Steps to reproduce:have a file on one of the monitors 
- fullscreen discord on another monitor 
- drag and drop the file in discord 
- notice how you can't start typing unless you click on the text field

####Expected result:
i should be able to insert text in the share modal instantly as it's the only text field i can type in on screen
####Actual result:
i can't type anything in unless i click on the text field to select it

### Can reproduce.
Can reproduce. I believe this is because after dragging, the source application (in my case Windows Explorer) is still the focused application, and therefore all text input is directed to it. Windows 10 Home x64 (1809), Canary  28059
