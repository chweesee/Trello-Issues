####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a friend to make this bug. 
- Connect to a DM voice channel. 
- One person should have headphones plugged in. 
- Same person should stream a game (with sound of it!). 
- Second person should hear choppiness instead of clear game's sound but for first person sound from game is fine because this person is not hearing it from stream. 
- (When I was testing it with friends all of us also have microphone plugged in.)

####Expected result:
My voice and game's sound should be clear and nice.
####Actual result:
My voice is clear but game's sound for my friends is choppy.
