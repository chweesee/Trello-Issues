### This is not a bug but intended, you can't start a channel name with a dash. No idea why this went through queue.

### Intended, a channel name cannot start with a dash or underscore, it can only end in dashes or underscores or have them in the middle. - Alexandru Todea on 2017-10-14T09:54:22.027Z


### Yeah, this is indeed intended.

### I apologize for not realizing that it was intended. **THIS IS NOT AN BUG**
