####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a Verified Server with a Server Banner that has a scrollbar 
- Get Unread Messages in one of the channels that you can hide from view when scrolling down 
- Scroll down and observe

####Expected result:
You could see the top "Unread Messages" Banner under the Server Name and can click it
####Actual result:
On Build 33599, where Server Names were moved up by Report 30503, you could see the Unread Messages Banner partially hidden - On 33633, this behaviour was fixed, hiding the Banner completely
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 33633
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro x64
