Reported by Tarek#1337

####Steps to reproduce:
- Post a store embed in a channel 
- Let it go up for a while in the channel 
- Be scrolled down all the way to the bottom of the chat 
- Search up a message around this embed and try to jump to it and observe how the client instantly jumps back to the latest message again 
- OR be on the bottom of the channel and search me up mentioning Ene#0808 in BHGC saying "show them" and try to jump to that (there is a store embed a few messages below it)

####Expected result:
It shouldn't jump you down again
####Actual result:
It jumps you down again to the latest message
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.219 (27804)
####System settings:
