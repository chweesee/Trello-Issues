Reported by Jiiro#1337

####Steps to reproduce:
- Make an app 
- Go to [YOURAPPID]/rich-presence/settings and replacd [YOURAPPID] to your App's client ID 
- Just connect via Simple Presence, that's what I did, connect it if you can, if you don't know how to, leave it up for someone else to approve 
- Don't put anything in the boxes and submit it

####Expected result:
Spectate and Ask To Join should disable you from submitting nothing and for you to wait
####Actual result:
you can submit something empty in those boxes and have to wait to get submitted
####Client settings:
[BUILD INFO] Release Channel: canary, Build Number: 20174
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro x64 1803
