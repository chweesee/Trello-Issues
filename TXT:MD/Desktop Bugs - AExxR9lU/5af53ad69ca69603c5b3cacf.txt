####Steps to reproduce:Open the server menu 
- Grant a permission that adds an option to the server menu 
- An option (maybe the first one) gets overwritten 
- If you revert the changes, it goes back to normal 
- If you remove a permission that adds an option to the server menu to someone who already has the server menu open then it'll remove that option without removing the space 
- Can be fixed by reopening the server menu

####Expected result:
The server menu should make an additional space for that the new option, if removing permissions, should remove space
####Actual result:
The new option overrides an existing option, if removing, the space for the option doesn't get removed
####Client settings:
Desktop Canary, 15032
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro x64 1803, Build 17134.1

### Can reproduce.
Can reproduce Windows 8 (6.2) Build 9200 x64 Discord Canary 15032 | It doesn't get overrided, but instead it shows a completely gray screen that disappears either when adding the role back or pressing escape. This only happens under moderation menu for me.

### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Home x64 1903; Canary 32878; Still able to reproduce this, to be precise, adding the Change Nickname permission to a user who already has a guild menu open will cause the "Leave Server" item to be pushed out of the menu from the addition of a "Change Name" being pushed onto the Menu.
