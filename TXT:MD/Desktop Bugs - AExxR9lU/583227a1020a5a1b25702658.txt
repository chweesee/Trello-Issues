### I don't think this is a bug.  My guess? You're clicking too low on the channel topic and not actually hitting the right area to bring up the pop up.

If anyone can provide a gif to disprove my theory, it'll be worth some xtra xp. - Jared on 2016-11-30T20:50:05.968Z


### Moved from User Reported Bugs to Not a Bug by Jared on 2016-11-30T20:50:10.049Z


### I was able to reproduce this, but it's due to the user moving the mouse while clicking. If the mouse is held still, it will open just fine. If it's moved a little bit, it does not open.
