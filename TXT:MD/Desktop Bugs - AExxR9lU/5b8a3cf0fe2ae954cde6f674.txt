Reported by Scrumpy#2763

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go into a guild call 
- In a channel in the same guild type '/tts `__words__`'

####Expected result:
You will hear '[Username] said "Words"' as the Underscores are markdown, You can prove that markdown is not supposed to be read allowed by typing "/tts `**words**` You will hear the narrator just saying "Words" instead of "asterisk asterisk Words asterisk asterisk"
####Actual result:
You hear '[Username] said "Underscore Underscore Words Underscore Underscore"'
####Client settings:
Windows Canary Build 22978
####System settings:
Widows 10 64x Home

NAB; This is an issue with Windows tts, not Discord (notice how it does say 'asterisk' if you type '/tts * test *'); Windows 10 Pro x64 (Version 1803)
