### Can reproduce.
CR, Win 10 x64, Canary 11517, It seems to work for your local language (ie if your local language was UK English, it wouldn't break) but not if you set your language to something else.

### This is in my opinion a valid bug.

If you have English UK enabled the question mark should go to en-us instead of going to en-gb and fail and redirect to an article which is not even translated in the system language.

So to put it in perspective it should go like this:
`Have English UK enabled -> Click on question mark -> redirect to support article which is the English one (en-us)`

Currently it's just:
`Have English UK enabled -> Clicking on question mark -> redirect to en-gb which doesn't exist -> redirect to system language -> Doesn't have translated article -> Article not found` - Tarek on 2018-03-04T04:19:36.302Z


### Can't reproduce, redirects to en-us article.  - Clayton on 2018-03-06T23:33:44.330Z
