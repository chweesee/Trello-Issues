####Steps to reproduce:
- Send or view an invite of a server with more than 1000 online and offline members (e.g Discord Testers invite) 
- Change your language to German or French (also works with others) 
- Observe the invite again and look for thousands separator for the offline and online member count

####Expected result:
You should see some digit grouping (thousands separator) for all languages.
####Actual result:
Some languages only show the thousands separator for the online members or neither of them.
