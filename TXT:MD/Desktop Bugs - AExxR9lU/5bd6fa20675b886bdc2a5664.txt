Reported by J1#0088

####Steps to reproduce:open the search bar 
- right click `clear search history` (you need to do a search first for the option to show) 
- notice that the search bar is still expanded 
- click on the search bar again and notice how the search board is a bit to the right

####Expected result:
nothing since im only right clicking something that's only left click-able
####Actual result:
the search board collapses and the search bar stays expanded and a offsetted search board the next search
####Client settings:
Discord Stable 27050
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64 ver. 1803
