Reported by Rex#2222

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have Discord Nitro 
- Join a server that has emojis 
- Change your Custom Status to an emoji from said server (No text) 
- Leave the server 
- Restart Discord or press CTRL + R 
- Observe how your Custom Status is broken. There will be an empty area under your name in the toolbar, and your profile will display the text ''Custom Status'', but with nothing under it.

####Expected result:
The emoji should either remain as the Custom Status, or the Custom Status should be cleared completely.
####Actual result:
The emoji is removed from the Custom Status, and the Custom Status remains as an empty nothingness.
####Client settings:
