Reported by Aru#8367

####Steps to reproduce:
- Add 2FA + backup phone number to account A. 
- Add 2FA + same backup phone number to account B.

####Expected result:
If, and only if, the number should really be removed from account A, the "SMS Backup Authentication" section of My Account, account A, should be updated to reflect the removal.
####Actual result:
The SMS Backup Authentication section still shows as enabled, on account A, but clicking "Reveal" shows no number and the account has no phone verification.
####Client settings:
stable, build Number: 13994
####System settings:
Arch Linux x64
