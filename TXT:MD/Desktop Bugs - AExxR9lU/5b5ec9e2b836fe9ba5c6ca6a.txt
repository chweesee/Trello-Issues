Reported by that15fine#9275

####Steps to reproduce:go to the developer docs page (https://discordapp(dot)com/developers/docs/resources/audit-log) 
- hover your mouse over a subheading, like "Audit logs" 
- Ctrl + click on the link icon that appears 
- observe the page that opens in a new tab 
- NOTE: This works for all subheadings in all categories of the developer docs. Clicking on the link icon normally will just scroll that section to the top of your screen.

####Expected result:
If you ctrl + click on the link icon, it should open the same page from the section the icon was next to.
####Actual result:
It redirects to the applications page.
####Client settings:
