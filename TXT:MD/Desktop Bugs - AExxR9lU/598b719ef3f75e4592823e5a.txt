Reported by Gallium#1327

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a server 
- Remove the text and voice channels 
- right click a user 
- mouse over Invite to Server

####Expected result:
The list of servers appears, save for the one without any channels, and thus, no invites
####Actual result:
The list is there including the server you just made, despite the fact you can't make invites for a server without channels.
####Client settings:
Canary 0.0.24
