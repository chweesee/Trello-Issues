Reported by zabszk#5292

####Steps to reproduce:
- open editing one channel 
- navigate to "Permissions tab" 
- close the viewer 
- open editing other channel 
- navigate to permissions tab 
- you can see permissions configured for the first channel (it "works" with the invites too)

####Expected result:
It is supposed to show permissions and invites for the second channel, not for the first opened previously.
####Actual result:
It displays permissions and invites from FIRST edited channel after launching Discord, even from channel in other server
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.211
####System settings:
Windows 10 (Version 10.0.17134.112)
