####Steps to reproduce:
- NOTE: Related to widescreen patches for the game, DM me for link to get it. 
- Load Pharaoh+Cleopatra. 
- Put the game into Windowed Mode (not a requirement, makes it easier to reproduce the bug). 
- Start a screenshare with someone you know. 
- Select "application window" and click Pharaoh+Cleopatra.

####Expected result:
The game and sounds from it are shared to the other user.
####Actual result:
Discord immediately crashes and reloaded.

### This issue only occurs if you edit the executable to make the game display in a resolution it was never intended to. While there does seem to be some legitimate bug here, it's so obscure that it's not worth the effort in fixing it. - Jared on 2018-02-06T21:25:03.325Z
