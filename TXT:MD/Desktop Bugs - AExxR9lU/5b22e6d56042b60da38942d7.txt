####Steps to reproduce:
- Be in a call with 2 or more people 
- Stream Dark Souls: Remastered 
- Attempt to speak through your microphone

####Expected result:
Microphone should function and people in call should be able to hear both game audio and microphone audio.
####Actual result:
Game audio sometimes works, microphone sometimes works, sometimes one or the other will fail to send audio. Discord reads as picking up the audio (green circles flash when recieving input, etc), but no audio is heard by others in call.
####Client settings:
Current non-beta version.
####System settings:
Windows 10 x64. Mic is Blue Yeti.
