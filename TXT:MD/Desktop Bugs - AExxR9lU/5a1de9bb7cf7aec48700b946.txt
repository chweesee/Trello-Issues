####Steps to reproduce:
- Set "Allow direct messages from server members." in User Settings to true 
- Message someone who shares a common server with you but is not your friend (we're going to call them Bob) 
- Set "Allow direct messages from server members." in User Settings to false  
- Create a new server 
- Be a part of the experiment 2017-11_friend-invite-guild-create that only a fraction of discord users are a part of 
- Under the "Invite Your Friends" menu that pops up click on "Invite" next to Bob's username

####Expected result:
Bob receives the invite once as a private message (that or Bob shouldn't be on the "Invite Your Friends" list at all)
####Actual result:
The invite link is spammed in the DMs (only seen by the user who created the server)
