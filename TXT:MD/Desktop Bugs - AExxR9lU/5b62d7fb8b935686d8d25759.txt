Reported by Ene#0808

####Steps to reproduce:
- Be in enough servers to be able to scroll down your server list 
- Position a server you're not currently in so that its icon isn't fully visible at the top or bottom of your server list 
- Click on it and observe

####Expected result:
You should only get scrolled the amount needed to make that server's icon completely visible like before
####Actual result:
You get scrolled down too far making the next server's icon partly visible
####Client settings:
