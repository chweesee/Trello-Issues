[Archived] Audio Devices dont work in discord after waking computer from sleep if power plan is set to High Performance unless you disconnect from the server or reload. On other power plans (Power saver, or Balanced) when waking the computer it disconnects and reconnects you to the voice server, so it doesnt experience the issue (https://trello.com/c/p4tuCnIJ)

P3: Will get fixed eventually,
