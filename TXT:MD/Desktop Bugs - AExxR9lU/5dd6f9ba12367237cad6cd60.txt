Reported by Keons#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- write a message, anything you want 
- click tab to make an indent

####Expected result:
an indent or such appears, and you can continue to type your message normally
####Actual result:
indent does not work, so tab button is useless, or it just moves the cursor to another part of discord
####Client settings:
Canary 49777
####System settings:
Windows 10 education x64 1909

### I repro'd it with the right version, but forgot to leave a cr. Now, I saw it and remembered I could repro and accidentally put it with the new version. Ignore my version
