Reported by mrkirby153#7840

####Steps to reproduce:
- Upload a file with a relatively long name (I used this_is_a_really_long_file_to_seewhathappens  [Without the space])

####Expected result:
The file name is truncated correctly (With ... or some other way of truncating it)
####Actual result:
The file name is cut off (The "a" in happens if using the above file name)
####Client settings:
Canary Build 10228
####System settings:
MacBook Pro 15" (2017) - macOS High Sierra 10.13.3
