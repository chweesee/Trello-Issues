### Okey, after a further analyze. Seems like it's **only** affecting the downloaded version of Discord PTB and Canary on Windows because of the Windows toolbar. 

Only workaround is to use Discord on the browser or use stable, It seems to happen when there is a scrollbar. And it seems to be stuck on the toolbar, since making the window smaller makes the modal scroll as well. - Tarek on 2018-02-28T17:07:31.259Z
