None

Reported by Matt | WizardCM#3776

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Looks like the prerequisite is to have an "old format" invite code on your server (the long ones) 
- Open Server Settings 
- Go to User Management>Invites 
- Attempt to view the full invite code of one that is truncated (with an elipsis) 

####Expected result:
 To see the full invite code 
####Actual result:
 You can only visibly see the first portion (roughly 9 characters) before the rest is truncated. Right clicking does nothing, and hovering does not show a longer version. Note that if you double click the invite code and copy it, pasting it elsewhere will show the full code 
####System settings:
 Win 10 x64 build 16170, Discord Canary
