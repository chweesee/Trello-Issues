####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to an active server 
- Make sure to send a message 
- Start editing it (Watch video on how to do so) 
- Start typing in front of a word or in the middle of the word 
- Someone will send a message 
- You will notice that your keyboard cursor is moved to the end and you are typing at the end of the word now

####Expected result:
You are supposed to still be in the same place where you are editing.
####Actual result:
You are redirected to the end of the sentence/word and cannot finish editing the previous words.
