Reported by Hazel#2212

####Steps to reproduce:Go in a server 
- Scroll down the list (no need to go all the way) 
- Go in some others servers (try multiples because it can be random) 
- Observe the list

####Expected result:
The list should reset because it's not the same server
####Actual result:
The list shouldn't be at the same point in this different server than in the other
