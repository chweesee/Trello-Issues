[Archived] Discord makes you think you joined `voice_chan_2` while in reality you are still in `voice_chan_1`! And it's also spooky (https://trello.com/c/jEaxg41w)

P3: Will get fixed eventually,

####Steps to reproduce:Perfect scenario for a bug to work: 
- Channel permissions: 
- 1st channel: View-off and Connect-on 
- 2nd channel: optional(View-on) and Connect-off 
- 1) User_1 ANYHOW joins the 1st channel (gets dragged into / uses invite-link); 
- 2) User_1 uses the 2nd channel's invite-link; 
- = Now User_1 thinks&sees he's in the 2nd channel, while, in fact, he's still in the 1st channel. 
- = Everyone (but User_1) can observe that User_1 is still in the 1st channel. 
- 3) User_2 joins the 1st channel; 
- 4) ??? 
- 5) SPOOKY VOICES!!! Try it out with your friends and family!

####Expected result:
-1) ...; -2) User_1 attempts to join it, but gets just thrown to oblivion (default)
####Actual result:
User_1 cheats! Try it yourself (mb with a dev-friend or a BOT) - it'll be more clear. Just follow the steps in [2].
