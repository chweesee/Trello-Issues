Reported by Amber#9295

####Steps to reproduce:
- Search something random in a server 
- Type an extremely long message with the search open (7-8 lines should be enough) 
- Close the search feature 
- Observe the extra lines that are underneath the last line of text

####Expected result:
Message bar extends with the proper number of lines
####Actual result:
Message bar extends with extra lines under the last line of text that disappear after typing again in the message (number of lines depends on how much text there is)
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 13939
####System settings:
Windows 10 x64
