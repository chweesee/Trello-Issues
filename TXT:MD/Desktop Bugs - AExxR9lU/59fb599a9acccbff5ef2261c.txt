####Steps to reproduce:
- receive a message with an embed with a timestamp 
- look at the embed in the Web UI

####Expected result:
Embed timestamp is formatted the same as message timestamp
####Actual result:
The message timestamp shows like `gestern um 08:48 Uhr`, the embed timestamp shows like `Mo. Okt. 30., 2017 at 05:20 PM`. This means the format is mixed german / english. Weekday and month are in german, the "at" is in english, the time format is 12-hour format, not 24-hour format, ...
