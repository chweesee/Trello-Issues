### Tested as of latest canary:

I can no longer reproduce this myself. Moving roles around, in any way works fine.

I did, however, notice a small 'flicker' issue when I moved them from time to time (for a split second the role was back at its old position before it moved to the new one I put it in.). But except for that, all good. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-05-03T00:53:46.383Z
