### Can reproduce.
The reason why the placeholder doesn't come up is because there IS text in the text box. Specifically, "&#65279;" is still in the text box, which shouldn't be there. This is also reproducible in other languages for example, Chinese, when you type "a" and just backspace. &#65279; comes out of nowhere, and cannot be removed until you switch channels or type something standard and backspace.
