### "Functioning as intended..." "...However, that's not the functionality we want it to have. When I asked Stan about it, he said we're planning on making it a proper feature one day and to report it so it doesn't get overlooked during the redesign."

### I can't reproduce this now that channel categories are a thing, I can simply unhide the channels by right clicking the server icon and then selecting the Hide Muted Channels option.
