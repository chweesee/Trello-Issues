### Another set of reproduction steps which was found by a non-BH are: 
- Click on + 
- Click Make a New Server 
- Watch as your Discord Canary crashes constantly in a loop because your client is attempting to connect to voice channel but cannot.

### Also can be reproduced by starting a DM call (voice)
