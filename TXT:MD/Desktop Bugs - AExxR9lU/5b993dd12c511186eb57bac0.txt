Reported by Cowsgomuu#3740

####Steps to reproduce:
- Get an instant invite link to a voice channel you cannot view 
- Join the channel 
- leave the channel by going directly to another voice channel (I tested it by going to a different server) 
- Rejoin the previous private voice channel that you can still see

####Expected result:
You should be removed from the private voice channel after leaving and should not be able to view it
####Actual result:
You can still view and reconnect to the voice channel as long as you dont press the disconnect button
####Client settings:
Release Channel: stable, Build Number: 23327, Version Hash: 155d861ee032dc13e06b22fad3c5b5ab40e190c5
####System settings:

### Can reproduce.
Win 10 64x (1803), Discord - Was only able to reproduce by connecting to a channel on a different server and not on the same server. (Make sure that the channel you have hidden is still "connectable" to everyone.
