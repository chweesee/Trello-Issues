P3: Will get fixed eventually

Reported by J1#0088

####Steps to reproduce:
- follow a game that has a long name (PUBG is a good example) 
- go to the activity tab then click on the game icon to open the game info modal 
- observe

####Expected result:
there shouldn't be transparent area in the modal
####Actual result:
the bottom bar and the news feed section have different widths which most likely causes a transparent part to be there but still have an outline
####Client settings:
Canary 34565
####System settings:
Windows 10 home x64 v.1809
