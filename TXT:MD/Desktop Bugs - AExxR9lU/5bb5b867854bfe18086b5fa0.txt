### Can reproduce.
all toggles show a different animation when you click the toggle image vs. when you click the text description to toggle the option. Clicking the toggle itself shows an animation where the toggle stretches & doesn't slide smoothly Dell Inspiron Windows 10, Host 0.0.258, Canary Build 49236
