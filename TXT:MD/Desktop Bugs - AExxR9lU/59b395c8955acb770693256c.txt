####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a server where you have the "Manage Channels" permission in your role 
- Have someone higher than you make a voice channel where only a role higher than you can connect 
- Create a category 
- Try to move the voice channel into the category

####Expected result:
Nothing should happen
####Actual result:
A prompt pops up asking to sync permissions or not (but you still can't add it to the category)
####Client settings:
Canary Build Number 4053
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro, Lenovo Thinkpad T400

### Tested on discord build 4743:

I can no longer reproduce this myself. I don't seem to be able to move locked (only roles higher than me can connect) voice channels around anymore. I suppose that's the fix @amadeus90 ? If it is, then this looks A-OK. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-09-22T14:59:58.697Z
