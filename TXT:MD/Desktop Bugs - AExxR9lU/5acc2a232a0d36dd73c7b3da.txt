[Archived] If a pictureless server has a name containing hyphens every 4+ words, the server icon will render with linebreaks after each hyphen (shows only the first line in server switcher, and shows all lines in a chaotic way in Mutual servers and Server settings) (https://trello.com/c/oCzbyzdP)

P3: Will get fixed eventually,

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a brand new server 
- Give it a name with a lot of words and with hyphens every 4 words (4 is the minimum), example `a a a a-a a a a-a a a a-a a a a` 
- (Optional) Invite someone to the server (Not a bot!) and open his Mutual Servers

####Expected result:
Especially in the case where there are only 4 words before the hyphen, everything should be on a single line, as if there were no hyphens
####Actual result:
The lines break after a hyphen, showing only the 4 first letters in the server switcher and renders in a chaotic way in Mutual Servers (certainly as a consequence of bug ZkshyYPj)
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 13313
####System settings:
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Asus Netbook F551C, Intel Core i3 64bits

### This bug is also visible on the invite to a server named this way, so in an invite via DM you will still see the line breaks.
