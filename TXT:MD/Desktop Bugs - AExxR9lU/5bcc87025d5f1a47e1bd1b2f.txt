####Steps to reproduce:First you Open OBS and make sure streamer mode is enabled and start the stream 
- Once the stream is started it will not display you are live on  
- End Stream and quit OBS and Discord will then display you are live when the stream is ended and stay displaying you are live up to 30min around after the stream ends 
- Disabling streamer mode after stream has still keeps the status you are live.

####Expected result:
Streamer mode was suppose to display I was streaming and when my stream ends, it was meant to turn off.
####Actual result:
Streamer mode doesn't display I am live and when I end my stream, it display I am live after it ended for 30min-ish

### I am unable to reproduce anymore as of Discord Canary Build 28567 on Windows 10 Home x64 (1809). My stream status disappeared as soon that I ended my stream and turned off streamer mode.
