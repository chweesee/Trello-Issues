####Steps to reproduce:
- Make the Discord window size the lowest possible 
- Go to the settings 
- Select Hypesquad 
- Make your window a bit bigger 
- Make it small again

####Expected result:
The Esc button is supposed to scale with the window size properly
####Actual result:
It just decides to disappear, until you make your window almost max size, or maximize the window.

Seems to happen on all screens that have the (esc) escape button. The escape button seems to ignore the resize event after initial resizing - Windows 8.1 Pro x64 Stable Build Number: 30024
