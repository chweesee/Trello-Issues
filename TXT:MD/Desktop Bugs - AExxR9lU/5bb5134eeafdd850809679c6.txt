####Steps to reproduce:
- send a bunch of messages till you get rate limited 
- toggle slow mode on, then off 
- the user will be unable to send messages, even with rate limitting and slowmode not preventing them

The user should be able to send messages with slowmode and rate limiting not affecting them.

I am unable to send messages
