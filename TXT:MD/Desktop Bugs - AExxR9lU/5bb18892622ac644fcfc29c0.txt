####Steps to reproduce:
- put slowmode to 120 (to have enough time) 
- write a message without Slowmode bypass 
- add slowmode bypass to the account 
- wait until it shows that u have bypass 
- remove bypass again

####Expected result:
Countdown is still counting down in the background (even if u have bypass in that amount of time) so the Countown should appear again.
####Actual result:
it only says "Countdown is enabled" and the Countdown is still hidden. AND: if u post a message during that hidden Countdown, there won't be that shake animation and the Message will just tun red for not beeing sent
