####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a game in the "Store". 
- Click on a game ( I clicked on Bad North). 
- Zoom in to 200% with ctrl + or command + (the video will also restart) 
- then zoom out to 125% with ctrl 
- or command 
- (it will restart again) 
- Your audio for the stores game trailers will be muted. To unmute them you can go to the bottom right of your video and click the audio button, or pause and play the video.

####Expected result:
The trailer should not mute your audio.
####Actual result:
The trailer will mute you from it's audio, and the audio from all other game trailers.
