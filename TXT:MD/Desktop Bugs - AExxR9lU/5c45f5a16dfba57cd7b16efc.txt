Reported by ScrxedDev#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Be in a server with a VC channel (**MAKE SURE THE VC IS FULL WHEN YOU START REPRODUCING**) 
-  Let someone make an invite via the VC (So the invite is linked to the VC.)  
- Join the server via the invite to the VC. (Even if ur already in the server, do not connect to the VC manually.

####Expected result:
Nothing should happen
####Actual result:
You hear the joining/leaving people the little bleep sounds. (NOT THE PEOPLE TALKING) (There is no leave VC button, you have to restart Discord to remove this.)
####Client settings:
Discord App: Version 31115
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home 64x
