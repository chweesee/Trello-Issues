Reported by Tarek1337#0379

####Steps to reproduce:
- Write a message 
- Click on a user in the member list, inside a channel, join a voice channel or mute your mic

####Expected result:
It shouldn't go out of focus, it should allow you to type again after you left the window (or stops clicking stuff)
####Actual result:
The chat box is not focused anymore and you have to click in the chat box again to write again.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.163 (Build 3994)
