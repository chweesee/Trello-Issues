####Steps to reproduce:
- Go Live 
- Popout the stream 
- Put 'stay on top' 
- Fullscreen the popout 
- Alt tab and try to switch to a different window(not the game though) 
- Redo the steps but now Don't put 'stay on top'

####Expected result:
The 'stay on top' icon should stay when fullscreened since it still works, or it should automatically turn off stay on top
####Actual result:
'Stay/remove from top' icon disappears when fullscreening
