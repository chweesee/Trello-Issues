####Steps to reproduce:
- Post composite words one-two one_two  one+two one~two one(two)

####Expected result:
Every composite word should be found when searching for "one" or "two"
####Actual result:
, one_two wont show up until you search for the whole thing. Could be the same for other characters.

### It's also occurs with "one.two" - one[period]two (in case it removes it again)
Period separated words are important for programming
