Reported by Info Teddy#3737

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open the New Group DM dialogue, either with Ctrl+Shift+T, or manually going to the friends list and clicking on it 
- Open the Quick Switcher with Ctrl+T or Ctrl+K, and then go to a text channel in a server from there (no voice channels, DMs, or group DMs). The channel HAS to be in a server that is already loaded/cached in the client, otherwise the client will request the server's data, which will reload the channel list and the bug won't happen

####Expected result:
Channel list and user list loads properly
####Actual result:
Channel list doesn't load at all and you can't click on any channels in it, and it will only load when you move to another channel
####Client settings:
Canary 0.0.19
####System settings:
Gentoo 64-bit default/linux/amd64/13.0
