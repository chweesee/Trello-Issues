Reported by Yannick#5937

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have at least 2 monitors. 
- Go to display settings and set the text scale to be a different value for at least 1 monitor, preferably one on the left. 
- Move Discord so that it to the right of the monitor with a different text scale, and note its position. 
- Exit Discord from the tray and re-launch it. 
- Observe Discord's position on your screen.

####Expected result:
Discord's main window should reappear at the position it was when it was closed.
####Actual result:
Discord's main window becomes offset by a varying amount of pixels, sometimes so much that it appears off screen.
