### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Pro 64-bit, Discord Stable Build 9672 | When input as "during 2018-01", it takes the first day of january, ex the client recognizes it as "YYYY-DD". When turned into "2018-01-02", is recognized as "YYYY-MM-DD". Confirmed initial theory by finding "2018-02" to be only posts from the 2nd of January 2018
