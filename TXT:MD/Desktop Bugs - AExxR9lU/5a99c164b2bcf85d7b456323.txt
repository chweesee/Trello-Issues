####Steps to reproduce:
- Play a song available on Spotify 
- Play a local song on your PC through Spotify 
- Switch back to another song streamed on Spotify

####Expected result:
Even though local songs aren't supported by Discord rich presence, playing anything else from the Spotify library after would still work, and the status would carry on updating properly
####Actual result:
The whole Spotify integration breaks, status will no longer update and will eventually disappear, and playing a song through someone's rich presence doesn't work either, until Discord is restarted
####Client settings:
Discord Canary build 11514
####System settings:
Win 10 x64
