####Steps to reproduce:
- First make sure to have the taskbar set to automatically hide by right-clicking on the bar and going into its settings. 
- Maximise Discord. If you use multiple monitors, make sure to maximise Discord to the first (main); since on my end it doesn't work on my end when I do this to my second monitor 
- Try to use the taskbar by moving to the bottom most point of the screen. 
- A GIF to prove: <http://i.imgur.com/oSQDvud.gifv>

####Expected result:
The tasbar should re-appear when you hover at the bottom, like in all other programms.
####Actual result:
The taskbar does not re-appear. The only way to get the taskbar back is to either Alt+Tab, or by pressing the Windows Key.
####Client settings:
Default Discord desktop program. Not in developer mode, and running version from 10.07.2017.
####System settings:
Windows 10 x64 Home Edition. Monitor: 1920x1080 @ http://i.imgur.com/oSQDvud.gifv 60
