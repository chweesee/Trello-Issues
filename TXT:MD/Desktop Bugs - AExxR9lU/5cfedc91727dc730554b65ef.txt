####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to the Server Explorer, the magnifier button. 
- Visit a Server that you aren't already a member in. (Example: Fortnite) 
- Click on someone's nitro-boost-badge in the member list 
- You have a option to boost the server (You need Nitro) 
- If you click boost, you'll boost a server that you aren't member in.

####Expected result:
You're supposed to get an error message that says something like "You need to join the server to boost".
####Actual result:
You'll be boosting a server that you aren't a member in.
