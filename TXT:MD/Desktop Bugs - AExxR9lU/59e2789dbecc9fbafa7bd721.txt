CR on Chromium based browsers (Chrome and Opera, not Firefox, build 5837), it's enough to click + (drag'drop doesn't work) => browse and select a file and Open => either cancel or upload in blue Discord popup => click + and browse again, select file, and cancel or press X to close explorer window => Discord crashes (see my attachment gifv)
