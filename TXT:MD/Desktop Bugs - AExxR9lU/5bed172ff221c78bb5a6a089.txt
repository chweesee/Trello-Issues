####Steps to reproduce:

- Login 

- Go to any random server you would prefer 

- Check for a Rich Presence that you or your friend has 

- Click on their profile 

- Click on the game (The title) 

- There is a list of ones that I've found: Fortnite, League of Legends, Minecraft, Grand Theft Auto V, The Sims 3, Destiny 2 (This list may work or not for you, it worked for me) 

- Watch attachment if you are confused
