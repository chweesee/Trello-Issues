### Can reproduce.
Canary (unknown build) on Google Chrome 70.0.3538.77 & Canary 27818 on Firefox Quantum 63.0, both on Fedora 28 with 4.18.16-200 kernel & KDE. Seems to also happen with normal messages; breaks it for everyone if message gets edited with broken emote; Firefox seems to reveal that the emotes are going backwards?
