####Steps to reproduce:
- Have two or more people in a Spotify listening party 
- Have someone other than the host send an invite to the party 
- Join the listening party via that invite 
- During a song, have the user who made the invite leave the party 
- Wait for the song to end and watch the listening party status and your Spotify status

####Expected result:
Either the correct host is shown and your status updates when the song ends, or you leave the party when the user that created the invite leaves
####Actual result:
When the song ends, you remain in the listening party, but your status is stuck at the end of that song
