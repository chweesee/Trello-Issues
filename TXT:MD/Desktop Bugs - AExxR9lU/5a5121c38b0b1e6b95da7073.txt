### Not convinced that this is actually a bug. And even if it is, I'm saying that it's too minor to ever bother fixing. - Jared on 2018-01-08T22:17:17.793Z

### This is different from https://trello.com/c/ragR27sR/1704-unread-message-badge-disappears-after-minimizing-discord-to-tray due to killing the task manager. In order to change the behavior we'd need to know the process was killed by the OS, which isn't something that an API is provided. - Jared on 2018-03-05T21:16:33.235Z
