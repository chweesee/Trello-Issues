Reported by Forgi_Forgeth#7294

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open a Discord server that you can fully manage 
- Get a high-quality 512x512 image (or any image) and upload it to change the server icon 
- Save the server settings 
- Whilst keeping the server settings tab open observe the changes and the quality of the image 
- You can try this with other images 
- Also note that this isn't an image compression since the files are under 100 kb and has even worked with files under 50 kb

####Expected result:
The quality of the image should not degrade upon saving the server changes especially when it is an image uploaded at 512x512
####Actual result:
The quality of the image does degrade upon saving the server changes and also degrades noticeably at 512x512 (which is the recommended resolution)
####Client settings:
Canary 0.0.218 (37031)
####System settings:
macOS High Sierra, Version: 10.13.6

### This is not a bug. We never guarantee quality will be lossless when you upload. We download image sizes in our clients which fit the size they are being displayed. For example, if you upload a 500x500 image we're displaying at 50x50, we'd download a 50x50 copy from our server. - nightwalker on 2019-06-06T18:46:14.134Z
