####Steps to reproduce:Make sure to have a chat channel that only a certain role has access to, and make sure you are in that role 
- Have someone @ mention you in that chat 
- Have a friend remove that role so that you lose access to that chat 
- Make that friend start typing/saying stuff while you check your mentions tab 
- Click the @ mention from that chat and scroll to the bottom

####Expected result:
No "live" chat. It should display the same messages as it was when you lost access to the chat.
####Actual result:
You're able to still see messages that were/are being sent after you left
####Client settings:
