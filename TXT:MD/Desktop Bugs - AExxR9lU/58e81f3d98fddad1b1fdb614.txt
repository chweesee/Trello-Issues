####Steps to reproduce: 
- Add a program as a game and enable the overlay 
- start that program and make sure the overlay loads 
- close that program and add a program like windows 10 mail as a game, make sure it has no windows open 
- hit the overlay toggle for the second program 

####Expected result:
 Nothing? 
####Actual result:
 Discord hangs forever, even upon restarting discord will hang. Delete your localstorage to get out of it 
####System settings:
 Latest canary, win10 pro

### I'd call this a high P2. However, the overlay is getting reworked significantly in the near future, so we need to wait for those changes before we'll be fixing any overlay specific issues like this. - Jared on 2017-10-17T07:13:03.533Z

### This was fixed with the overlay update recently. - Jared on 2018-01-05T19:44:01.547Z
