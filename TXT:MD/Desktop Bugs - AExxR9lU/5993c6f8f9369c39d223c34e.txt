####Steps to reproduce:
- Add a note to a user (make it several lines, like 8 or 9) 
- Scroll up chat enough so their icon is near the bottom of the chat window 
- Click on their profile icon

####Expected result:
The profile card will appear and be fully visible.
####Actual result:
The profile card appears and is cut off, because it runs off the bottom of the screen, as shown by the attachment.

### Can reproduce.
Having a collapsed voice chat and clicking on a user brings the profile up under the icon, not next to the channel/member. It also scrolls past the discord window. Trying to chat with them (e.g. copy-pasting something which automatically goes to the DM bar in the profile pop up) moves Discordup and into space, as shown in the attached picture. | Windows 10 Pro x64, Release Channel: Canary 10189
