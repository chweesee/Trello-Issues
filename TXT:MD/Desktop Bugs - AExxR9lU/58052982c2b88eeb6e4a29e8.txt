Steps to Reproduce:

1) Maximise the window to full size (or even enlarge it to any size you wish)
2) Minimise the window to taskbar
3) Wait for a notification or just click the tray icon.
Expected Result: The app will reappear in the previous state that it was minimised in.
Actual Result: The app reappears in the default window size.

Client Version: Canary latest version, but happens in every build
System Settings:  Windows 10 x64.
Notes: Has been happening for a while and hasn't been fixed, but reposting for it to be moved to the Trello(edited)
