Reported by J1#0088

####Steps to reproduce:
- go to library 
- start installing a game 
- before the game is done downloading, minimize discord

####Expected result:
a desktop notification saying that the game is ready to play should show
####Actual result:
no desktop notification when discord is minimized but it does show when not minimized which doesn't make any sense
####Client settings:
Canary 33046
####System settings:
Windows 10 home x64 v.1809
