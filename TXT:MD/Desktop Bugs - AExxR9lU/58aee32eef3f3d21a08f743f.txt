####Steps to reproduce: 
- Open User Settings 
- Click to upload a new avatar 
- Select a GIF that has a longer width than height or vice versa ( Test Images: http://i.imgur.com/b6Gf3rK.gif / http://i.imgur.com/F44L9Nv.gif )  
- Upload said GIF and it will correctly display, despite the preview image. 

####Expected result:
 Image preview should match the result after upload. 
####Actual result:
 Preview does not match and is misleading
