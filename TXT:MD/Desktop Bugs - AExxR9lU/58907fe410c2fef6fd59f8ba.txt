### Can reproduce.
I saw this issue in a different way: I went to a server where I could see voice channels clearly (DTesters), then jumped to a server where they weren't visible, and then clicked back. Voice channels were completely missing and weren't visible unless i clicked a channel on the server. Windows 10 Home x64 with the Anniversary Update.
