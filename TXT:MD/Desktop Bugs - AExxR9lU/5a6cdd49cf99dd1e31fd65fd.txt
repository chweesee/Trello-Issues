####Steps to reproduce:
- Create/get a rich embed 
- Add a field for it 
- Use markdown (for example bold `**` or italics `*`) for the field name 
- Observe the outcome in Discord

####Expected result:
Some Markdown should be shown for the field name of the embed like for the iOS version (there you can see the Markdown)
####Actual result:
Field name has always the same "style".
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.185 (Build: 10015)
####System settings:
MacBook Pro 13" (2016), macOS High Sierra 10.13.3
