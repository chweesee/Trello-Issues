Reported by TheOnlyArtz#5743

####Steps to reproduce:
- Spam emojis in an input form like `:smile::smile::smile::smile::smile::smile::smile::smile::smile::smile::smile::smile::smile::smile::smile:` but couple of times (the higher the better) 
- leave the last one to be like `:smi`

####Expected result:
You should be able to choose the emoji on the last one
####Actual result:
You can press the emojis on the menu and nothing will happen
####Client settings:
Discord canary 15032
####System settings:
Windows pro x64
