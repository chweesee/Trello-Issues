[Archived] When you are in call and the internet goes out/ discord is shut down for a short while. The disconnection sound keeps going off repeatedly, and when you try to manually disconnect from call sometimes it takes a while to fully disconnect. (https://trello.com/c/9Pw5wWMZ)

P3: Will get fixed eventually,
