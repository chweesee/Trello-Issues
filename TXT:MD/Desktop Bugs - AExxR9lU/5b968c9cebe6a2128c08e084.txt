####Steps to reproduce:-Have spotify account linked, and set it so the songs you're listening to can show up as your status. -Put your spotify song on repeat, and then pause the song.

####Expected result:
It should stop and show nothing, just like it does if you were to pause the song without it being on repeat
####Actual result:
On your status, the song will continue to count the time left until the song ends like the song is still playing.
