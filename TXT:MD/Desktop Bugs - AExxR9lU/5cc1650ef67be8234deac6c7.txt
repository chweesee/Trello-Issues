Reported by Forgi_Forgeth#7294

####Steps to reproduce:

- Open discord. 
- Go to a server you can upload an image (also works with gifs). 
- Put any image/gif and let it stay as a prompt when it asks you if you want to finally upload the attachment 
- Click out of discord (don't exit the client). 
- Click back into the client 
- Hover over the servers you are in and observe if there are tooltips (the black and white labels) 
- Also works for videos and other types of attachments

####Expected result:
There should be labels when hovering.
####Actual result:
There are no labels when hovering.
####Client settings:
Canary 0.0.218 (36318)
####System settings:
macOS High Sierra, Version: 10.13.6
