### Cannot reproduce. Potentially fixed already? - Jared on 2017-08-21T19:37:38.114Z


### I am unable to reproduce this bug, even with the steps & info below provided by DeJay#3628. Furthermore, bot audio is not affected by a voice channel's bitrate setting, so that part of this report is not a bug in the first place. The device I tested on is running Windows 10 Pro x64, Fall Creators Update, Discord Canary 0.0.168 (6558).

- Use a bot to constantly stream audio 
- Set Voice Bitrate to Max (96Kpbs)
- Check RTC debug for "Available Incoming Bitrate"
Expected Result: 
A nonzero value (96000?)
Actual Result:
A value of zero - Chris Cox on 2017-10-30T05:08:37.279Z


### Ticket has been marked as Cannot Reproduce for longer than a month with no activity. Archiving ticket. - Jared on 2017-10-30T17:26:12.802Z
