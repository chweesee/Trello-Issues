### I cannot reproduce the bug as written.  Here's what I see happening.

1)  Launch desktop client.
2)  Change the dimensions of the application window to any non-maximized setting.
3)  Click on the Maximize button
4)  Click on the Minimize button.
5)  Get pinged so that a desktop notification appears
6)  Click on desktop notification

Result:  The Discord window appears at the dimensions from step 2.

Is this correct? Or am I missing something?  Moving to CNR until clarified. - Jared on 2016-12-06T19:57:32.289Z
