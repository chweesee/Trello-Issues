### Can reproduce.
I was able to repro with nitro badges but not HypeSquad, it will also throw missing access and access denied errors/warnings. Discord Canary 0.0.163 (Build 3388) on Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (Build 1607) https://i.imgur.com/XTI2ZyS.png

### This isn't a bug. You're not able to get information from them if you don't share any servers, this also includes badges. You'll note you can't see if they're online either. - Jared on 2017-08-21T20:32:46.168Z
