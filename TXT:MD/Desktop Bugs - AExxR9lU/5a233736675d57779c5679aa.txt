### Can reproduce.
Discord Canary 0.0.180, (Build 6463) on Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (Buld 1607). It's NOT related to osu!, It's happening to every rich presence game, probably even custom made RP status.

### Verified, it indeed happens to all games with RP, even custom RP statuses. 

in my opinion I consider this as a bug since it should be streaming > RP > regular playing status, I could be wrong. - Tarek on 2017-12-08T05:41:20.191Z

### Spoke to Jake about this, and it's currently intentional behavior.

Moving to not a bug. - Tarek on 2018-07-06T04:00:37.468Z
