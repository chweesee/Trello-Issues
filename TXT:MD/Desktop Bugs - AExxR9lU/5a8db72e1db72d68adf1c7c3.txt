####Steps to reproduce:
- Get either somebody talking constantly at a constant volume or a music bot (music bot preferred) 
- Join same voice channel as that person/bot 
- Make them start making a constant noise at constant volume 
- Right click name and adjust user volume lower, for example, 5% (not tested on higher percents) 
- Reload/restart Discord (CTRL+R) 
- Rejoin voice channel if you aren't in it 
- Observe that user volume slider is where you left it, but the user/bot sounds as if they're at 100%

####Expected result:
User volume should be the same as the slider
####Actual result:
Although slider shows user volume as where you left it, it'll play at 100% anyways
