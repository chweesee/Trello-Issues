Reported by gustav341#7460

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open a call with someone 
- Open the Windows Sound Control Panel (You can do this by right clicking the volume icon and selecting "Recording Devices") 
- Go to the Recording tab if you haven't already done so, select your microphone, and click "Properties" 
- Go to the "Advanced" tab 
- Change the "Default Format" to something other than the current setting, and click "Apply" (I changed it from CD to DVD)

####Expected result:
Discord uses the new setting
####Actual result:
Discord (Sometimes) notices when you're talking, but doesn't transmit any sound
####Client settings:
Stable 8854
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home 1709
