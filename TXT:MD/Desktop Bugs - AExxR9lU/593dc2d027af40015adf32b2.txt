[Archived] In a heavily populated server with lots of roles; add someone to a role that's placed higher than their current placement in the channel. The user card will vanish, instead of staying open. (https://trello.com/c/aOiqZrVd)

P3: Will get fixed eventually

Reported by Mr.Caleb#8593

####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a user in a heavily populated server with lots of roles being displayed separately from regular users. 
- Give the user a tag that's placed higher than the area you're currently scrolled to in the member list of the guild. 
- Give the user the role and watch the module vanish.

####Expected result:
The module will stay open, even though the user is placed past the member list area you're currently scrolled to.
####Actual result:
The user card module is randomely removed, but will stay if the user is being granted a role that isn't listed past the section you've scrolled to in the Guilds member list.
####Client settings:
Canary 0.0.157
####System settings:
Windows 10 x64 bit
