####Steps to reproduce:
- Use any kind of input for voice that doesn't actually broadcast audio (or has some kind of hardware mute) 
- Insure that mic input sensitivity is manually set to -100dB 
- The bubble in voice should appear illuminated.  
Note that having a sensitivty of -99dB will work as expected.

####Expected result:
Voice chat bubble will only illuminate when it is actually receiving input
####Actual result:
Voice chat bubble will appear always on, but *only* when sensitivity is at -100dB
####Client settings:
stable 20579
####System settings:
Windows 10 x64, v1803 - Build 17134.165
