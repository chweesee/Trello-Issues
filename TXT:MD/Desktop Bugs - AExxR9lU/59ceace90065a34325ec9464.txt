####Steps to reproduce:
- Create 2 (or more) channels with the same name like "Test" 
- Make sure there are messages in both channels 
- Open second "Test" channel (make sure it isn't the first one) 
- Use `ctrl/cmd` + `f` there to open the search with channel filter 
- Click enter 
- Observe the search results

####Expected result:
Search should only contain results from the second "Test" channel
####Actual result:
Search will always only contain results from the first "Test" channel
