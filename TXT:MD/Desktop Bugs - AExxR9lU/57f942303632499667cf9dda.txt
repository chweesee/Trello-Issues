Short Description:  Rejected Friend Requests still show as pending.
Steps to Reproduce:

1)  Send FR
2)  Have it be rejected
Expected Result: Pending no longer shows outbound request.
Actual Result: Pending status stays.

Extra FoxBot said there is supposed to be a WebSocket Event on the request update, but I saw none in the Dev Tools.
