####Steps to reproduce:
- Have Discord Nitro 
- Find an emoji ID (example: 414542501043765258) 
- Go to a different server. 
- Send a message there like so: `<:here_you_can_put_whatever_you_want:414542501043765258>` 
- Have a different member of that server report what they see when they hover over the emoji in chat. 
- Instead of the real emoji name, they will see `here_you_can_put_whatever_you_want`, and that can be text as long as you want. 
- **Note:** If the person hovering over the emoji shares the server that the emoji's on, they'll see the real name.

####Expected result:
**Either:** Discord finds the real emoji name via headers on the image or a seperate request **Or:** Discord constrains the text length of that field.
####Actual result:
That text is as long as you want.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary, 0.0.217
####System settings:
Arch Linux x86_64, KDE Plasma
