[Archived] When the next hour has started in client time but not yet in server time, message breaks between a single user's messages repeatedly appear and disappear (https://trello.com/c/QKsyJk1A)

P3: Will get fixed eventually

Reported by Haddock#3102

####Steps to reproduce:
- Set PC clock 1 minute ahead 
- Find a channel where no one else is talking (might interrupt test) 
- Send a message right before the hour rolls over 
- Send messages after

####Expected result:
The server just inserts the message break when *it* thinks it's time, since this would just lead to one delayed message break sometimes on the hour
####Actual result:
Each time a new message is sent until the server's hour also rolls around, a message break appears, then disappears
####Client settings:
0.0.298
####System settings:

### Can't reproduce.
NAB. It is intended to do message break appear then disappear. The message IDs are prior to Discord's clock, not user's.
