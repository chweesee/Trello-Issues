Reported by Ene#0808

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go into a channel you can send messages in 
- Type a little message 
- Open the Gif Picker, select a gif and observe

####Expected result:
Either the gif should not automatically be being sent and should just place the url at the end of your message or it should not be removing your text from the text field and instead send it alongside with the gif
####Actual result:
The selected gif gets automatically sent and any text previously entered into the text field is removed
