### This only works if the file name contains two single-quotes without a space between them.

### Verified with a file named `quote''quote`. This is such an edge case bug and reworking the file upload system is scary, so unless someone can figure out a more common reproduction case, I'm marking this as Won't Fix. - Jared on 2018-02-22T18:56:24.104Z
