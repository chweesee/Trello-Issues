### Can reproduce.
CR | Windows 10 Home x64 Creator's Update, Discord Canary 0.0.163 (Build 3788) | The modal seems to be opening a copy of itself on top of itself every time you press enter, meaning that pressing "close" doesn't return you to the settings menu. Instead, it reopens the modal, and will do that repeatedly until you've closed every existing copy of it.

### I tested this bug during the Trello cleanup event, and was not able to reproduce as of Discord Canary Build 18317 on Windows 10 Home x64 (1803). My client just carries on and refreshes, as if I have accepted that I wanted my voice settings reset. So I am moving it to Claimed Fixed.  - Ghoul on 2018-07-08T05:07:30.398Z
