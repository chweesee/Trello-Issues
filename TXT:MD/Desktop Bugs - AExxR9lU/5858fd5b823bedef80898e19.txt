### Did you know on PC that you have to highlight text before ctrl + c will copy it to the clipboard? Same thing.

_Why doesn't it just copy the message that you right clicked on?_

Because you wouldn't be able to copy more than one message at a time. - Jared on 2017-01-03T21:10:52.423Z

### This behaviour can be simulated by right-clicking a channel link and copying it.
