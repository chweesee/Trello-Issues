Reported by KJP12#3880

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open an invite modal on any server/channel 
- Have someone DM you or if you have another client open, DM someone

####Expected result:
The friends/DM list should stay the same until you refresh it
####Actual result:
The order changes on you instantly, prone to making you accidentally invite someone else
####Client settings:
Google Chrome 67.0.3396.99 (Official Build) (64-bit) with Canary 18240
####System settings:
Fedora 28 with KDE Desktop Environment
