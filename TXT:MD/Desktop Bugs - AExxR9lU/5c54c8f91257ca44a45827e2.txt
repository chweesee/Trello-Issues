- Start lurking in a server 
- Click on a user in the user sidebar who you know has nitro/hypesquad/early supporter badges 
- Open the large profile (not the mini profile) for that user 
- Notice how the badges are not shown

####Expected result:
The badges should be shown, like if you were actually a member of the server
####Actual result:
The badges on the large user profile are not shown
####Client settings:

### I don't think this is a bug, showing badges is relies on sharing mutual servers/being friends.
