None

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Click on any user to open mini profile 
- Write something in first line, then do Shift + Enter to input a linebreak 
- Repeat this step until the textbox is expanded to maximum 
- Keep going on step 2

####Expected result:
I should be allowed to input as many linebreaks as I want as long as I'm below the user note character limit, and the textfield should be scrollable in case it cannot expand anymore
####Actual result:
When the texfield is expanded to maximum, doing Shift + Enter does absolutely nothing
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 17022
####System settings:
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Asus Netbook F551C, Intel Core i3 64bits
