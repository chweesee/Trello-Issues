####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to User Settings 
- Go to Connections 
- Observe the possible connections under Connect your account (iOS 10 is under Add)

####Expected result:
The connections are sorted in alphabetical order, like Android and iOS 11
####Actual result:
The connections are sorted in some other kind of order. The only difference is when the Xbox Live connection came to Desktop
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.210 (Build 16727) & TestFlight 2.3.2 (4760)
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64 Version 1803 (OS Build 17134.48) & iPhone 5s, iOS 10.0.1
