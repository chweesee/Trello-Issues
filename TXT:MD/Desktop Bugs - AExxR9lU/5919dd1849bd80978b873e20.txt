####Steps to reproduce: 
- Be on a parner server 
- Have no admin permissions 
- Have "read audit logs" permission 
- Go to server settings 
- Scroll down 

####Expected result:
 The "Server Invite Background" is greyed out because you aren't allowed to change it 
####Actual result:
 It's not greyed out and it allows you to open the upload dialogue 
####System settings:

### Can reproduce.
Can reproduce on Windows 10 Home x64 (AU 1607), the server background can be changed even though I don't have permission to change this stuff. Not related to audit log permission however.

### This doesn't seem like a common use case at all, but I could see it happening somewhere. High P3. - Jared on 2017-10-17T06:50:47.265Z


### It's not really grayed out, but I can't open the upload dialogue, so I am marking this as Claimed Fixed.
