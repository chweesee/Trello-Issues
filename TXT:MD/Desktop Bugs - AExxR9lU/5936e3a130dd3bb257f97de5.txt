### While this is fixed for Spanish (it goes to the english article), it's still broken for every other language, which clearly isn't the intended behavior. This bug is not fixed. - Jared on 2017-07-31T22:44:27.349Z

### Technically this isn't a bug with Discord, it's a bug with the website and should go through support@discordapp.com - Jared on 2017-10-17T06:13:32.447Z
