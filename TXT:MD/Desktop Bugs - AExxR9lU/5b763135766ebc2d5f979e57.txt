### It's possible the overlay hasn't had time to hook to the game yet. Do ya'll see the notification about the overlay before you try the keybind? - Joey Baker on 2018-08-17T18:18:30.044Z

### The notification for the overlay doesn't show up at all, however, looking in the console, there is the "Overlay connection to XXXX succeeded" message logged as well as logs of events presumably being dispatched to the overlay, so I'm assuming the overlay is hooked into the game. Also, various Discord overlay handles are visible using a tool like Process Explorer
