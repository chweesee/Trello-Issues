Reported by Rashaun#9295

####Steps to reproduce:
- DM call someone or join a VC in a server with screenshare 
- Start sharing your screen 
- Switch to a server so you have the mini box that shows your screen 
- Press the "Turn on camera" button

####Expected result:
Discord turns on your camera immediately
####Actual result:
Discord takes half a minute before the button changes to show that your camera is on, but still shows your screenshare not camera (asked the person I started a call with and they reported seeing my screenshare and not camera)
####Client settings:
Canary Build 20790
####System settings:
Win 10 x64 1803
