### Cannot reproduce.  Here are my steps:

1) Log into account A in firefox.
2) On the friends page, account B appears and is online.
3) In the desktop client, change B from "Online" status to "Invisible".
4) In Firefox, account B disappears from the online friends list.
5) In Firefox, progress to a mutually shared server with account B.

Result: Account is is shown as being offline. - Jared on 2017-01-17T19:52:19.274Z
