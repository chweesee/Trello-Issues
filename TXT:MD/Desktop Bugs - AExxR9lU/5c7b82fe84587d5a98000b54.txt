####Steps to reproduce:
- Ensure you have a role which is denied message history permission in a server or channel 
- Open pinned messages for the server or channel you are denied message history permissions for 
- Jump to chat in any of the pins 
- Observe that the chat history loads regardless of your permissions

####Expected result:
Jump to chat doesn't function if you don't have message history permissions (as is the case in Canary)
####Actual result:
Jumping to chat from pins loads the message history
####Client settings:
Discord stable 33117
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home 64-bit
