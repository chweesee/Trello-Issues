####Steps to reproduce: 
- Open WoW with Overlay Enabled (Appears Without a Doubt) 
- Click on Overlay wont work so open the overlay with a keybinding (in this case Shift + ') 
- Close the Overlay with the Discord Icon as Normal 
- Try Clicking on it again (now it wont open) 

####Expected result:
 Discord Overlay Should Open 
####Actual result:
 WoW Overrides the control and thinks your moving the map/In Game World 
####System settings:
 Windows 10 Pro Anniversary Edition, Latest Discord Canary

### I don't understand this bug.  You should NOT be able to open the Overlay by clicking on it, ever.  That would be a horrible experience for someone actively playing a game.

This is also unrelated to the bug bounty.  Could someone please elaborate? - Jared on 2016-12-06T23:04:29.191Z
