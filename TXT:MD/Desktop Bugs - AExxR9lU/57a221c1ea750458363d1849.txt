Short Description:  the "All" and "Online" friend lists do not change Discord's window name
Steps to Reproduce:
1)  Open a text channel or DM
2)  Discord's window name changes to the channel name
3)  Open the friends list under Direct Messages in "All" or "Online" view
Expected Result: the window title should change to "Discord", as it does when viewing the "Pending" or "Blocked" list
Actual Result: the window title doesn't change from the last DM or channel name

System Settings:  Win 10 x64, tested on stable, PTB and canary.

Screenshots:

2)  http://i.imgur.com/PgfArM6.png is the same for the pending list, with the correct window name in the taskbar.
