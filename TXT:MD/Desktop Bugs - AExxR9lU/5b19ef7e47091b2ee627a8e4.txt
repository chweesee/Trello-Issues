####Steps to reproduce:
- Enter a text channel where you have link embed permissions. 
- Send one message containing URLs to two videos which are both handled by Discord's native player (e.g., Streamable; for ease of replication, use paths "/l7bid" and "/bydom") 
- Once sent, both videos are embedded below the message. 
- Play the first video. 
- While the first video is playing, edit your message, adding lt and gt symbols ("<" and ">") around the first URL. Press enter to confirm the edit.

####Expected result:
The first video, now escaped, should stop playing and be removed from the message.
####Actual result:
The first video continues playing in the second embed. The remaining embed has URL 2's title and URL 1's video.
####Client settings:
Desktop Canary, Build 16487
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64, Build 16299.431

### This seems like intentionally destructive behavior to me. It's a minor issue at best and is a really strange edge case. I'm making an executive decision and saying that this is a Won't Fix. - Jared on 2018-06-08T20:17:11.257Z
