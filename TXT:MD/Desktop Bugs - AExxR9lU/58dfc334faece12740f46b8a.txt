### I don't believe that this is a bug. Quoting Dabbit Prime, who quotes Stan on the issue of "translations breaking the UI": 
"If the translation breaks the UI in that it's not functional, It's a bug.  If the text is cut off and making it two lines would fix it, it's a bug.  If the text is cut off and the UI would need to be redesigned to fix it, it's not a bug."

This seems like it falls within the latter definition, but I will wait for Dabbit (or any other Employee) to confirm this.
