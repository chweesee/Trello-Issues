Reported by Marc#5983

####Steps to reproduce:
- Ensure you're in 100 servers 
- Have a friend or an alt spam a bunch of the same invite link in your DMs 
- stay on that dm channel, press the little plus at the bottom of your list, join server, enter the code and observe the embeds in the back

####Expected result:
They don't do anything
####Actual result:
They freak out and question themselves - then realize that it's an invalid link since you're at max servers
####Client settings:

####System settings:
