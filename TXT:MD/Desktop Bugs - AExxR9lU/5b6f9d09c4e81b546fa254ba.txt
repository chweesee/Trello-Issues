[Archived] If you remove the profile picture of a bot through the dev panel while the bot account is offline, the profile picture will remove in chat history but not in profile (https://trello.com/c/1nKP2LoO)

P3: Will get fixed eventually,

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a bot with a profile picture set 
- Have it send a few messages in the channel of your choice 
- Disconnect your bot and make sure it is completely offline 
- Go to the Discord developers dashboard, go to the Bot tab, and remove the profile picture of the bot account 
- Refresh your client to make sure the old profile picture would not stay cached 
- Open the channel where the bot sent the messages back in step 2. Notice the profile picture is gone 
- Now open the profile of the bot. Notice the profile picture is still there

####Expected result:
The profile picture should uniformly appear removed across the client: either both in profile and in chat history, or none of them until the bot goes online
####Actual result:
As long as the bot stays offline, it will be in a state where it has no profile picture in the chat history, but keeps it in his profile
####Client settings:
Non applicable as it is cross platform. Personally I accessed the dev dashboard on Firefox for Android 61.0.2 and observed the issue in the Android client (Discord Alpha 7.2.9)
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
