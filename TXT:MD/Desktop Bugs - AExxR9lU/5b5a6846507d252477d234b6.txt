Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a website with a long description, with an HTML entity near the character limit that the embed can show (very uncommon case so try with the link in attachment) 
- Post the link of this website in Discord

####Expected result:
If a character represented by an HTML entity doesn't fit in description, it should be removed completely
####Actual result:
The HTML entity is half cut off making it render bad near the spot where the text truncates.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.1.6 (affects all clients)
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
