####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to the add friends tab 
- Search/send friend requests until the popup appears 
- Observe how the cursor remains in the textbox and you can type 
- Observe how when you hit enter, it not only closes the popup, but resubmits the friend request resulting in yet another popup

####Expected result:
The cursor should no longer be in the text box.
####Actual result:
The cursor remains in the text box.

### Believe it or not, this is actually a dupe of https://trello.com/c/fJV49Rhw/164-spamming-messages-at-a-ludricous-rate-causes-more-than-one-chill-zone-dialog-to-appear-clickling-through-all-of-them-can-take-a

The reason that issue ^ happens is because of what's noted here. The cursor is still in the text bot which makes the pop up show up again. It's the same bug. However, as noted in that ticket, it's a Won't Fix and the solution is to not spam so much. - Jared on 2019-01-02T18:36:02.904Z
