Reported by Rajiv Shah#5322

####Steps to reproduce:
- Send a message with a link that shows an image in its preview (e.g. a link to a post from Instagram)

- Click on the image

- Click "open original"

####Expected result:
The alert that says "HOLD UP: This link will take you to..." appears in front of the image
####Actual result:
The alert shows behind the image, so the user can't see it and doesn't know why the original was not opened
