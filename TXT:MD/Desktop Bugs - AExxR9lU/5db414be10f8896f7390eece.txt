Reported by karl-police#3660

####Steps to reproduce:
- Choose an GIF emote that you will use on the Custom Status and write in the chat 
- Send the GIF emote in the chat 
- After that, set the custom gif emote on your custom status 
- Go to the message and click on your username, the animation should restart when you click on it

####Expected result:
I think it would be better if it wouldn't restart?
####Actual result:
The animation of the emote restarts after clicking on the user profile that also has the same emote in the custom status
####Client settings:
Google Chrome Version 78.0.3904.70
####System settings:
Windows 10 64 Bit, 1803
