####Steps to reproduce:
- Be playing a game that Discord has registered as your activity before 
- Begin streaming using a software like OBS 
- Wait until your status becomes purple and you are listed as streaming 
- Disable streamer mode using the banner at the top of Discord 
- Observe

####Expected result:
You are still playing the game, so Discord should make that your status
####Actual result:
Discord just disables the streaming status and puts you back at basic Online with no game activity
####Client settings:
Canary 32273
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro
