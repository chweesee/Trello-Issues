Reported by Thiago#3958

####Steps to reproduce:
- macOS required (A mac with Apple's T2 security chip IS REQUIRED, considering it handles your microphone)  
- Connect to a voice channel (doesn't matter if it is a DM or guild/server channel) 
- Call someone using FaceTime (or accept a incoming call)

####Expected result:
Discord should continue to work (and shouldn't randomly log you out)
####Actual result:
Discord freezes (and sometimes, you get logged out)
####Client settings:
Canary: 34801
####System settings:
macOS 10.14.4 @ MacBook Pro 2018
