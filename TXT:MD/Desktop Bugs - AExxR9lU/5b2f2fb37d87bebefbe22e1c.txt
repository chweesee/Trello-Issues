[Archived] When scrolling up with mouse to the point that 'Loading More Messages' shows at the top, chat sometimes jumps to a random spot (only happens when using scroll bar with mouse; canary only?) (https://trello.com/c/m7ixoIn1)

P3: Will get fixed eventually,

####Steps to reproduce:
- Scroll up until you see 'Load More Messages' 
- Sometimes after messages load, you end up with a different message in view than before loading 
- Sometimes you end up with the same message in view as before loading

####Expected result:
The message that was in view before loading should stay in view.
####Actual result:
Discord sometimes jumps to a seemingly random message rather than staying in the same spot after loading more messages (may have to test multiple times to get random jump)
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.52 build 17486
####System settings:
openSUSE Tumbleweed 20180618
