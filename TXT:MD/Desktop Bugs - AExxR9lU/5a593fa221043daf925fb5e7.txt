####Steps to reproduce:
- Open an image preview inside Discord 
- Hover the cursor over it

####Expected result:
The cursor should stay in the arrow cursor state when hovering over the picture.
####Actual result:
The cursor turns to the "pointing hyperlink hand" cursor state, despite the image not being able to be clicked directly to do any action.
