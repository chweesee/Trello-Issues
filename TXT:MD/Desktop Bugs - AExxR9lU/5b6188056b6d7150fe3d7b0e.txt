Reported by » a r i a#1593

####Steps to reproduce:
- update canary to 20386 
- get into a call with someone and let them turn on video screen 
- notice that the video window is tinier than in previous builds 
- try to press the button that makes the video larger (bottom left)

####Expected result:
The window is bigger and you can fullscreen the DM video
####Actual result:
The window stays the same (tinier than previously) and you can't fullscreen, avatars overlap on the right
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 20386
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro x64
