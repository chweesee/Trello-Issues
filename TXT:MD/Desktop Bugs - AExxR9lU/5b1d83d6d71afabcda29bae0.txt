Reported by webhp#1337

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a user copy a message link in a DM. 
- Click on that link.

####Expected result:
Not sure, I think it should show something saying you don't have access to the channel. The same thing happens with servers/channels you don't have access to but it will stop loading eventually on its own.
####Actual result:
It loads indefinitely.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 16727
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro x64 v1803
