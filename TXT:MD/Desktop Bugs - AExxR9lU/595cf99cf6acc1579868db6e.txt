####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure you have 2FA enabled on your account 
- Logout of the client via User Settings 
- Log in with your email and password 
- Press login on the 2FA screen without typing in a 2FA code

####Expected result:
A popup error should appear saying "This field is required", as is the case with the main login screen.
####Actual result:
It stays blank, implying nothing is wrong, allowing you to be ratelimited if you end up spamming it.
####Client settings:
Desktop Canary 0.0.157 (Build 2012)
####System settings:
Win 10 Pro x64 v1607
