####Steps to reproduce:Open up a game that is able to Go Live. 
- Observe the area where the Go Live area would be. (make sure there's unread messages further down the channel list). 
- Close the game after an X amount of time.

####Expected result:
The channels that are behind the Go Live bar should be visible, even after it disappears.
####Actual result:
The channels that are behind the Go Live bar are not visible when the bar disappears. They appear once you move the list.
