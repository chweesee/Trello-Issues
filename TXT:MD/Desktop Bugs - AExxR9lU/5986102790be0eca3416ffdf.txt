Reported by seven8timeðŸŽ¼#5914

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a text channel with no pinned messages 
- Click the Pin menu 
- Read the text at the bottom that says "Pro Tip" 
- Realize that there's no cog menu anymore, but the 3 dots on each line of chat.

####Expected result:
It should say something like "Users with manage messages can pin messages from the 3 dots (or whatever it's called now).
####Actual result:
It shows the wrong information (cog menu).
