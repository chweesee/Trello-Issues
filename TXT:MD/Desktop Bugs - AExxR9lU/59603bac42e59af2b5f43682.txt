### Checked as of latest canary build 2134:

I can no longer reproduce this. CTRL+Ving an image through clipboard (ShareX) or copying an image from a website work just fine.

However, right-click copying an image file doesn't work with CTRL+V. I can't confirm if this was the case prior though or not. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-07-08T10:13:11.638Z
