[Archived] If you click the "mention" button on a dead invite in a channel you don't have perms to type in, you'll have a draft in quick switcher (https://trello.com/c/1tGrbqTC)

P3: Will get fixed eventually,

Reported by Dropheart#6441

####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a channel that you don't have perms to speak in, which contains a dead invite 
- Click the "mention" button on the dead invite (you must have the new invites for this) 
- Go to two other channels (to clear last channel) 
- Click control + k and observe

####Expected result:
It shouldn't allow you to be able to use the mention button since you don't have permission to actually send messages
####Actual result:
It allows you to use the mention button, but the text box stays the same with the no perms message, and the channel appears in quick switcher under drafts
####Client settings:
Canary, Build Number: 8055
####System settings:
Zorin OS, based off of Ubuntu 16.04
