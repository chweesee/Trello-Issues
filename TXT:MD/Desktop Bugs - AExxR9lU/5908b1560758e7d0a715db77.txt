Reported by rovertdude#3439

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Have a 2FA-enabled server without 2FA enabled (dont believe it works if you own the server) 
- Add a bot that suggests a permission blocked (e.g. admin) 

####Expected result:
 It doesn't allow you to add it 
####Actual result:
 It allows you as if you still had permissions 
####System settings:
 Windows 10, latest Discord
