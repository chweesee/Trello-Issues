Reported by Ene#0808

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go into a server and right-click on a user either in chat or from the Member List 
- While the context menu is still open, attempt to click into another server

####Expected result:
The context menu should close and you're taken into the server
####Actual result:
The context menu closes, but you're not taken into the server, requiring you to click it again
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.216, Build 27223
