### Can reproduce.
partially... when using the keybind Ctrl+Up to mute my mic, Ctrl + Shift + Up triggers it too. Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Up however didn't. Windows 8.1 Pro x64

### Can't reproduce.  Ctrl + Key works.  Shift + Key does not.  Ctrl + Shift + Key works, that's to be expected (both necessary keys are pressed). - Jared on 2016-11-30T20:15:15.513Z

### JBYoshi#5551 submitted these steps, however they fall under the same situation as Dabbit's comment below, both necessary keys are pressed anyways, and any other key pressed is just superfluous.
1) Go to your keybinds list
2) Map ^G to Toggle Streamer Mode (I also reproduced with ‚åòG and ‚å•G)
3) Exit the keybinds page, but stay in Discord
4) Type ^‚åòG. (I also reproduced with ^‚å•G)

Expected result: Nothing happens
Actual result: Streamer Mode is toggled on/off - Mike Nisbet on 2017-10-30T13:37:06.418Z
