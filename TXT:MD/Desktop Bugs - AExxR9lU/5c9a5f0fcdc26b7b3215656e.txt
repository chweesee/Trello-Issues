### Can reproduce.
Win10 Pro x64 (1809) | Discord Canary 34565 | Can repro, however this may be a feature request as for I have clicked "Copy" on about 30 different news posts, and not once seen the "Copied!" text. I have no proof that it ever did say "Copied!" even though it seems like it should (Feature request.)
