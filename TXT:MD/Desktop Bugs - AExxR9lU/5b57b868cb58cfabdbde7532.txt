### Clarification on the steps: There are two ways to reproduce this bug. The first way, which is demonstrated in the attached gif, being 1) Ensure overlay notifications are enabled 2) Open a game with the overlay running, 3) Open the overlay and go to the DMs tab, 4) Start a call with anyone, 5) Quickly close the overlay either with the X button or the hotkey and look in the corner where you set the overlay notifications. â€” The other way to reproduce would be 1) Make sure overlay notifications are enabled, 2) Open a game in windowed mode with the overlay running, 3) Position the game window and discord so you can see both at the same time, 4) Start a call from the main client and observe the overlay notification.
