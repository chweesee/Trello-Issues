[Archived] Desktop: Creating a new role doesn't inherit current @everyone permissions; pulls server default permissions. (https://trello.com/c/rIirGShg)

P2: Fix can wait a while

Created: Unknown
Latest Update: 2017-10-17T20:27:06.365Z

Steps to Reproduce:

1) Progress to the Roles tab of Server Settings.
2) Edit the Everyone permission to have any set of basic permissions.
3) Click on the "Roles +" button.

Buggy event:  The basic set of permissions the new role is given upon creation is different from the base set in the everyone role.

Expected: The basic set of permissions is identical to those in the edited everyone role.
