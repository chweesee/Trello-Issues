### Cannot reproduce. After both restarting the client, and closing the client and relaunching the bot is always muted on resume. - Jared on 2017-10-09T21:33:51.829Z

### I am able to reproduce this, you don't need to reload your client, you can just leave and rejoin the voice channel after muting the bot. Here are my repro steps: 

- Join a voice channel and have a bot play music in it, I personally used FredBoat and had my alt join the voice channel too so it wouldn't automatically pause when I leave
- Mute the bot (not server mute)
- Reload your client or leave and rejoin the voice channel

I would just like to note, they say this only applies to music bots, I've confirmed it applies to any muted user, at least for me, if they are transmitting voice while you join.
