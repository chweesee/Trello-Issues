####Steps to reproduce:
- First have a person in 2 group dms 
- If they send a message in one and you flick between the two of them then you see the typing status in the other dm that the person isn't typing in

####Expected result:
You shouldn't see them typing unless you are looking at the other dm that they are actually typing in
####Actual result:
If a person is in 2 group dms then when they type in one it shows them as typing in the other one

### Can't reproduce.
The typing literally stops after a second; as the animation is just playing out. This also only happens when you swap right from the dm where the other person is typing in; it does not happen on it's own.
