####Steps to reproduce:
- Launch Discord 
- Use it normally for a day or so without closing it. Sleep is fine. 
- After around a day, open Activity Monitor and take a look at RAM usage

####Expected result:
It should have relitively normal RAM usage.
####Actual result:
RAM usage is rather excessive, around 700-800, sometimes 900MB
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.156
####System settings:
macOS Sierra 10.12.6, iMac 14,2/iMac 18,1

### This isn't a bug. Of course we're going to be using more memory if the app has been running for multiple days. - Jared on 2017-11-14T19:09:34.151Z
