[Archived] When a previously-offline server comes back online, it is prepended to the top of the list rather than where it was previously (https://trello.com/c/FeU0GovR)

####Steps to reproduce:
- Join a server that periodically goes offline (usually because it has hit its user cap).

- Move it somewhere in the middle of your server list (anything except the first one. I personally put it 4th out of my 40-some servers.) 

- Observe it going offline and subsequently giving you the (!) icon at the bottom of your server list. 

- When it comes back online, it is prepended to the top of your server list as the first server, rather than where it was previously moved to.

####Expected result:
It should be where it was previously moved to in the order of your server list.
####Actual result:
It is prepended to the top of your server list as the first server.
