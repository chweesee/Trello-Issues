Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- This bug technically affects all clients since it's about missing string exports on Crowdin, but the bug is only observable on Android because of https://trello. com/c/2BskgKam/ 
- Make sure you're using a language different than English 
- Find an invalid channel mention. Notice it's translated 
- Find an invalid user mention. Notice it isn't translated 
- You can also go to Crowdin and notice that `invalid-channel` is present but not `invalid-user`

####Expected result:
Both `invalid-channel` and `invalid-user` should be exported to Crowdin so they are available for all languages
####Actual result:
Only `invalid-channel` is exported, which is inconsistent because both strings are used in the same context (aka invalid mentions)
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.8.1 (affects all clients)
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
