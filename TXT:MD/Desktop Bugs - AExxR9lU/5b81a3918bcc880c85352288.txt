### Can reproduce.
iPhone X (13.2 ðŸ˜ƒ  ), TestFlight 3.1.6 (17924). This occurs not only with channel mentions, but also when: 1) clicking emojis from the picker & the suggestions as you type an emoji. 2) selecting text and marking as spoiler. 3) Tapping the suggestion when typing a user mention. Itâ€™s all seemingly linked to tapping suggestions/shortcuts.
