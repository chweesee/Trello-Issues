####Steps to reproduce:First, you HAVE to be using Chromebook OS 
- Next, go AFK for 10 or more minutes for it to show the "Idle Status" (for it to reproduce, you can't change your Status Manually to idle) 
- Once your Discord Profile is idle try moving your mouse/cursor around and your Profile Status will stay as idle 
- Change your Status to something different (ex. "Online" or "Do Not disturb") once clicked on a different Status, it won't change to a different status and will stay as "Idle"

####Expected result:
It's suppose to change your Discord Profile Status from "Idle" to "Online"
####Actual result:
Whenever trying to change your status from the "Idle Status" , it won't let you
####Client settings:
Discord Canary Browser, 31785
####System settings:
HP ChromeBook Version 69.0.3497.120 (Official Build) (64-bit)
