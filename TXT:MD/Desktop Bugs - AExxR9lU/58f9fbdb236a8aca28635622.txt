Reported by Matt | WizardCM#3776

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Go to Server Settings -> Roles 
- Select @ everyone 
- Hover your cursor over THE ON/OFF TOGGLE SWITCH (not the description) for "Allow anyone to mention this role" 

####Expected result:
 The error "Disabled for @ everyone" should appear 
####Actual result:
 Only the cursor changes, and no error appears. This is confusing to the user. 
####System settings:
 Win 10 x64 build 16170, Discord Canary

### I have fixed this issue, although it's not yet deployed - Amadeus on 2017-04-22T02:12:19.046Z


### Moved from Server Settings Redesign Bugs to Claimed Fixed, needs Verification by Amadeus on 2017-04-24T07:46:17.290Z


### Can confirm this is fixed as of the last canary deploy. Needs official Discord Employee verification as well. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-04-24T12:58:43.653Z


### UPDATE:

The behaviour was changed here (spoke to Amadeus). The popup only happens when you hover over the disabled icon (uploading a gif of it now).

It's still fixed though, so moving over. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-05-02T23:43:27.347Z
