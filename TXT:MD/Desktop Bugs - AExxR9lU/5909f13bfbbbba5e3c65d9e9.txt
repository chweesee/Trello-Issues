Reported by Mr.Caleb#8593

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go into a group chat with a few friends.
- Click the file upload button and wait to be kicked from the group.
- Upload the file and your client will freeze until you soft-relog Discord. 

####Expected result:
 Client freezes after the file is uploaded to the conversation you are kicked from, requires a soft-reboot in order to begin working again. 
####Actual result:
 You can hover over items, server icons and general responsive areas of the application but it won't do anything when you click on it. Dark Theme // Compact // Win10 // Using downloaded discordapp for win10
