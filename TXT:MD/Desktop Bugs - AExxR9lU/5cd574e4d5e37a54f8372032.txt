Reported by TheSheepGuy#3378

####Steps to reproduce:
- Set Windows to auto-hide the taskbar (right-click on the taskbar, go to settings (the bottom option), turn on auto-hide on desktop (second option)) 
- Maximise Discord on the main (first) monitor. 
- Try to access the taskbar. PS: This was a bug before in Discord, but was fixed. I cannot find the old report in the Trello, so I assume it was removed.

####Expected result:
The taskbar could be accessed as normal.
####Actual result:
The taskbar doesn't appear again, preventing access and forcing the user to press the Windows key or to Alt+Tab.
####Client settings:
Canary (Build Number: 37253, Version Hash: 818758a6ad5e844be56a5ff543f0db672f01bc1c)
####System settings:
Windows 10 x64 in desktop mode.
