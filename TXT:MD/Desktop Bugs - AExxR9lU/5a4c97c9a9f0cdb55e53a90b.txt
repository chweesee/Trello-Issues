####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Channel Settings or Server Settings and make a permission change to a role 
- Attempt to exit out of the page or enter another. Note: Don't use ESC to exit the page, as there's a bug not yet fixed that causes it to exit through the Unsaved Changes message.

####Expected result:
ESC button stays in place
####Actual result:
ESC button jumps out of place until you exit and re-enter the settings page.
####Client settings:
