### This was intentional-ish. Would need a design for how we want to render it if we want to add this. @christinazou1  - Mark Smith on 2018-08-11T00:26:58.552Z


### Going of from Zorkian's comment, this looks like a feature request and should be moved to not a bug

Confirmed it with Dabbit. - Tarek on 2018-09-04T17:54:45.665Z
