### Not a bug, Discord doesn't support unicode characters that overflow. Bug Bot "bugged" and sent this to trello without going through queue...

### Apparently the mods can't edit or delete comments. Here's a clarity note: the last sentence in my previous note is invalid, although the bot did bug in some way. The other sentences are valid (nab, not supported etc)
