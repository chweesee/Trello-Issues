####Steps to reproduce:
- Open a server's notification settings. 
- Scroll to the bottom of the modal 
- Click the "Select a channel or category..." drop down. 
- Scroll down the new, extra space in the modal. Your scrollbar should remain flush with the bottom of the modal. 
- Close the drop down menu by clicking the arrow again.

####Expected result:
Modal window is re-sized correctly, and the scroll bar remains flush with the bottom of the modal as before. When the drop down is opened, extra space between the scroll bar and the bottom of the modal is created, and can be scrolled correctly. Verified on Chrome 66
####Actual result:
Modal is resized, but the scrollbar's position does not change, and can be continued to be scrolled until it is underneath the bottom of the modal (clipped at the rounded bottom). When the drop down is closed, the modal is resized, but there is now a gap between the scroll bar and the bottom of the modal that cannot be closed until the modal is reopened.

### This ticket was checked during the Trello cleaning event, and it is still reproducible on Windows 10 Pro x64 with Discord Canary Build 18226. Because it is still reproducible, I am leaving it to be. - Ghoul on 2018-07-06T05:24:25.978Z
