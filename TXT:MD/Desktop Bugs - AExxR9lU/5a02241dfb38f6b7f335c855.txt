### Can reproduce.

### Can reproduce.
This only appears to occur with images which are rotated with the EXIF tags, meaning preview is not respecting them. Desktop stable build 6768, Win10 x64

### What's interesting about this is that the image that Pascal added has the exact same effect on Trello. This tells me that this isn't a bug with Discord, but something weird with the image itself. This is Not A Bug. - Jared on 2018-03-22T21:36:32.189Z
