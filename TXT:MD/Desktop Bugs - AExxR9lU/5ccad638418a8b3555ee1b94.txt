####Steps to reproduce:
- Find someone who could reproduce it with you 
- Get in a call 
- Ask them to start screenshare of Google Chrome (for example: YouTube video) and make sure the audio is playing 
- Now play the video 
- Ask you partner to stop playing the video 
- Ask your partner to end screenshare BUT do not close any application on the system 
- Now ask them to start playing video again 
- BOOM! You can still hear the video's audio

####Expected result:
No audio continues playing
####Actual result:
Audio still playing even without screenshare itself

### Can reproduce.
When you try to turn the camera on afterwards, screenshare will be turned on instead, mirrored for the person turning on the camera (Because camera feed is mirrored for the person). Also, indicators on the camera - such as lights on Logitech ones - will go on, showing that they are active, but they are not showing in Discord. | Windows 10 Pro x64, Release Channel: Canary 36779
