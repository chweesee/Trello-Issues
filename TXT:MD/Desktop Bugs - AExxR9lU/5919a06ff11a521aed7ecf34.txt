### Checked on canary build 7256:

I can still reproduce this myself, the line is actually "Enable OverlayUpdating (%)" for me and doesn't do anything at all.

Not sure if that's an issue just for me or if it's more widespread. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-11-13T13:31:56.364Z


### The overlay is now also unable to be updated. Just stands at "ENABLE OVERLAYUPDATING (%)" and the overlay is never actually updated
