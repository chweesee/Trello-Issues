when clicking on a user profile, then going into mutal servers and right clicking a server makes the option menu for the server pop up, but most options are broken and will not open until you close the profile tab (https://trello.com/c/VgYmj2Sv)

P2: Fix can wait a while

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Go to somones menu (preferably someone with a mutual server you have admin perms in). 
- right click on said mutual server 
- click on one of the settings option (Something like server settings, Notif settings, or Privacy settings). 

####Expected result:
 the menu shouldn't open at all or open on click instead of open when closing the profile tab. 
####Actual result:
 Clicking on one of the settings seems to do nothing, but actually shows up when closting the profile tab. 
####System settings:
 Win 10, Latest canary.
