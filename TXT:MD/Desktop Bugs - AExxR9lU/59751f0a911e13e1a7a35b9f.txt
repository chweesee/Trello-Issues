### @kamillakarthigesu1 Hey there!

This seems to be fixed now for "Hide names".. But it still occurs to collapsed categories with voice channels in them, do you think it's the same bug, or should it be a separate ticket? - Tarek on 2018-02-01T03:36:20.808Z

### Hey @tarek1337 :)

I wasn't able to replicate the issue you're seeing with collapsed categories. What I did was create a new category, and in that category, I created a text channel and a voice channel. I joined the voice channel, collapsed the category, but was still able to view the User popout when clicking on my avatar. (See SS- I joined 'test channel' in 'Read This' which had other text channels) [Screen Shot 2018-02-01 at 12.18.54 AM.png](https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/5771673855f47b547f2decc3/59751f0a911e13e1a7a35b9f/a41645c0073e08498eb129eceb0437af/Screen_Shot_2018-02-01_at_12.18.54_AM.png)  - Kamilla Karthigesu on 2018-02-01T08:21:28.370Z


### @kamillakarthigesu1 My bad! Seems it's working fine, I tested this when you first moved it, and I could only open the user profile in voice channels with "Hide names" checked. :sweat_smile:. I'm moving this to claimed fixed, Thanks again. I appreciate it. - Tarek on 2018-02-01T08:40:47.787Z

### Ah I see now...

If **an another** person is alone in a category with a voice channel which is collapsed. You can't click on that user.
