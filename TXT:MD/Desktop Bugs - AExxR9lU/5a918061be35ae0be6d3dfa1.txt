Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Post a GIF in a channel with a long message history 
- send another 10 messages in the channel so the GIF is not at the bottom 
- while the GIF is playing, scroll through the chat and observe the GIF

####Expected result:
It should still be playing smoothly. Alternatively, the GIF could eventually pause until you stop scrolling
####Actual result:
While scrolling, the GIF plays at an inconsistent speed (pauses randomly, skips frames, etc)
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 11055
####System settings:
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Asus Netbook F551C, Intel Core i3 64bits
