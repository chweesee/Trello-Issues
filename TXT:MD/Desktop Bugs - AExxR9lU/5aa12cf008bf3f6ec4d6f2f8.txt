[Archived] When you're full-screened on a video and get mentioned, there is no "New" mention banner in the server list for like 2-3 seconds (https://trello.com/c/sox22OjO)

P3: Will get fixed eventually,

Reported by Tarek#1337

####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure the server is all the way the bottom (because of an another bug the server list scrolls up) 
- Go into fullscreen on a YouTube video in a server 
- Get mentioned in the server you moved to the bottom 
- Go out of fullscreen 
- Observe there is no "New" mention banner for a few seconds

####Expected result:
The banner should appear since you have new mentions
####Actual result:
There is no banner for 2-4 seconds making you miss it while watching a video and leaving you confused.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.203 (11719)

### More information is needed to reproduce this. If you have a suspicion about something, that's not sufficient to re-open it. I need to know if that's the issue or not before I'll re-look at the bug. - Jared on 2018-04-16T18:19:24.744Z


### Still cannot reproduce with new reproduction steps

`- Make sure the server you're going to get mentioned in is near the bottom of your server lists or at least out of view once you scrolled back to the top
- Go into full screen on either a Twitch or YouTube Live Stream from a link in another server
- Get someone to mention you in the server you dragged down your server list
- Leave full screen
- Wait 1 to 3 seconds for the "new" red banner to pop up`

The banner still appears immediately after coming out of full screen. - Jared on 2018-04-23T18:20:50.164Z


### Archiving as this ticket has been CNR for more than 30 days. - Jared on 2018-07-06T18:31:59.622Z
