####Steps to reproduce:
- Connect to any voice chat you want. 
- When RTC Connecting shows, disconnect as soon as possible. 
- If you did it fast enough, discord should crash (or restart.)

####Expected result:
It should disconnect you like normal, and it SHOULDN'T crash your discord.
####Actual result:
Crashes (or reloads) your discord.

### Can reproduce.
After bashing my mouse button a million times to disconnect and then reconnecting to the voice channel only to disconnect at RTC.  I was able to reproduce. It just needs to be at a specific time, then the client will crash and reload. Windows 10 Professional x64 - Fall Creators Update, using Discord PTB (Build 10905)

### This is SO timing specific that it can't be considered a P2, so I reduced the priority to a P3. However, I was able to reproduce this.
