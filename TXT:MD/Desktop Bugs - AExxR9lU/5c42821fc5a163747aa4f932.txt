Reported by lindhespoon#5905

####Steps to reproduce:
- Start app, place at secondary monitor and maximize window 
- Minimize app to tray by pressing X and re-open (location and size restored correctly) 
- close/restart program, (size remembered but window defaults to your main monitor).

####Expected result:
It should remember the size and which monitor to be presented on. Like all other programs I've used (chrome, steam etc).
####Actual result:
The discord app window does not save its window state, it defaults to the main monitor after restart.
