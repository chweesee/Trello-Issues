####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Discord. 
- Set the TTS settings under notifications to read ALL channels. 
- Mute a channel you don't want TTS notifications from. 
- Listen for TTS messages from the muted channel.

####Expected result:
I would imagine that muted channels would ignore the TTS setting and stay muted.
####Actual result:
TTS reads off all messages from the muted channel.
####Client settings:
Build Number: 33760
####System settings:
