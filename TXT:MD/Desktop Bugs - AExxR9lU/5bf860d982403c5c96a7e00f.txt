### Hey folks, I'm trying to reproduce this issue and haven't been able to. Is this still happening for you? If so:

- Does it happen every time you play an embedded video or just sometimes?
- Does changing your video settings make any difference? Does windowed vs. fullscreen mode matter?
- Does the resolution of the video matter? - Joey Baker on 2018-12-11T21:37:05.553Z


### Can't reproduce.
Cannot reproduce. tested with CSGO, Clustertruck and R6S. (used twitch/youtube embeds) Windows 10 home x64 v. 1803 - Canary 29340. might be somehow related to https://trello.com/c/YXqTQXuk/

### Can't reproduce.
Can no longer reproduce this bug... This seemed to simply be a one off bad build of Overlay which caused Embeds to crash upon loading. And No this is not related with to XXXX being blocked on your network as shown below. Win10 64x (1809), Discord Canary 30296
