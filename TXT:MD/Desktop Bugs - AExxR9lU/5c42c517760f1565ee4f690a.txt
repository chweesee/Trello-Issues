### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 stable, Discord canary build 30945 | I can only seem to get this to occur with Xbox wireless devices, when using my pair of turtle beach headsets and wirelessly connecting them to my computer discord requires a restart in order to see it as an input. This could be an Xbox wireless device specific bug.
