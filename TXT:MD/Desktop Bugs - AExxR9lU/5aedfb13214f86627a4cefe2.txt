####Steps to reproduce:
- Create message (for example, rules) containing 2000 characters in a text editor entering unicode characters for emoji 
- Step 2 
- attempt to edit the message after pasting into discord, the emojis will have been converted from their unicode character to the discord format, using more characters

####Expected result:
either the ability to edit a previously submitted message without having to shorten it or be unable to submit a message over 2000 characters, which is diffcult if you use unicode characters rather than discord format. Or do not count :characters: in message counts.
####Actual result:
Message does not allow editing without shortening to below 2000 characters. Example, 2000 ‚òï sent will render as almost 16,000 characters if you try to edit the message it will not allow it until shortened
