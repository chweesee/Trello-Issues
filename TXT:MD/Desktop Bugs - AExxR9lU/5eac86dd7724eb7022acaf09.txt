Reported by wakfi#6999

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open emoji picker 
- Click left side side to expand, near a server icon (need to be more on the left than the right of the space you can click and have the <--> arrow) 
- Drag left really fast

####Expected result:
Emoji picker should get big really fast
####Actual result:
You see an image of the nearby server icon being dragged by the mouse, and then when you release the emoji picker follows your mouse resizing without you holding click
####Client settings:
Canary 58858 (d79f8df)
####System settings:
Windows 10 64-Bit (10.0.18363)
