####Steps to reproduce:
- Change a channel description to something with bold, or italics in it. 
- Look at the entry for it in the Audit Log 
- See how it either doesn't escape the formatting correctly (bold) or it just causes none of the formatting to work (italic)

####Expected result:
The formatting gets escaped correctly.
####Actual result:
The formatting either gets ignored from what I can tell or it escapes it in a weird way causing it to look abnormal <(http://imgur.com/a/cH5C7>)
####Client settings:
Desktop Canary 0.0.19
####System settings:
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

### Could be on purpose, but formatting doesn't show at the header of the channel , only in the opened description
