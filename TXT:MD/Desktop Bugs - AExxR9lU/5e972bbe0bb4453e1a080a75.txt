####Steps to reproduce:
- Navigate to your server settings to edit your server description 
- Enter some text with some lines breaks 
- Click save

####Expected result:
Discord successfully saves.
####Actual result:
Discord saves the server description, removing any line breaks. Presumably it detects changes from the input field and the current server description, making the user stuck and still prompting the unsaved changes popup.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 54393
####System settings:
MacBook Pro: macOS Catalina 10.15.3
