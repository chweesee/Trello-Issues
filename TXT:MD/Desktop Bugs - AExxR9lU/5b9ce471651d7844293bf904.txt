####Steps to reproduce:
- Own, or have Manage Channels permission on a server. 
- On that server, have multiple friends join a voice channel and play games so it appears in the Activity tab. 
- Open the Activity tab. 
- Find your friends, then right click the name of the voice channel.

####Expected result:
Settings like creating channels shouldn't be visible. These settings would be expected to only appear if you're actually inside the server.
####Actual result:
You're able to do strange actions that probably shouldn't be visible within the Activity tab.
####Client settings:
Canary 23836
####System settings:
MacBook Pro (13", Mid-2012), macOS 10.13.6
