####Steps to reproduce: 
- Send a message 
- Become unable to send messages because of server verification, either by having the server level raised, or leaving and rejoining a server on the highest (10 minute) level 
- Attempt to edit your previous message 

####Expected result:
 Similar to how you cannot edit messages when you are missing Send Messages permissions, it is expected that you cannot edit messages when under Server Verification level restrictions as well 
####Actual result:
 You can edit the message even without being able to send messages, which is inconsistent with Discord's permissions system

### I disagree with the statement that this is inconsistent with Discord's permissions system. None of those things have the intent of stopping you from editing previous messages, just sending new ones.

That being said, this is functionality that we would probably benefit from having added. As such, it's a feature request and not a bug. - Jared on 2017-01-03T19:30:10.142Z
