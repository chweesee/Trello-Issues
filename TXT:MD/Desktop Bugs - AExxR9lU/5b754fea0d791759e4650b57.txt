Reported by » a r i a#1593

####Steps to reproduce:
- get into a video call with your best friend 
- make sure both of you have your videos/screenshare on 
- make sure to show both feeds (doubleclick on your partner's video) and click on the enlarge button 
- resize discord until the videos are shown below one another 
- as you resize vertically (do horizontal first, then vertical resize), the bottom bar (hover to show "leave call etc") will vanish 
- ! This behaviour happens automatically when on ~ 15.6 and split screen, as it has the required window size 
- click away and back into the dm and observe

####Expected result:
The call should re-order itself earlier to avoid the clipping (make client smaller to see what i mean)
####Actual result:
The navigation bar clips into the top bar
