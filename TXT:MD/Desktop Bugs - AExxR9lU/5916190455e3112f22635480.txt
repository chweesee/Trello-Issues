####Steps to reproduce: MUST HAVE ONE SERVER OUTAGE 
- Have so many servers that you are able to scroll down 
- Grab a server from the top 
- Try to move past the original place of the server that is out and put it down the list
- The list will scroll 
- See that the placeholder goes away after you get to the bottom of the list 
- Let it go at a place where you want it 
- See that the server jumps back to it's original position 

####Expected result:
 The placeholder stays and you can drop the server at a place where you want it 
####Actual result:
 The server jumps back to it's original position after letting go 
####System settings:
 MacOS 10.12.4, Discord Canary 0.0.145
