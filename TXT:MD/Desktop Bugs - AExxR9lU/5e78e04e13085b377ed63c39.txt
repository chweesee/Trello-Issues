### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Pro OS Build: 18363.778, Stable 58583 (b7763a5). This was able to be reproduced at zoom level: 110% 125%, 150%, I personally used "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZe_EjOFzL4&feature=youtu.be" and "https://tenor.com/view/funny-animals-dog-dance-cute-smile-gif-12759384". Though I believe it occurs with any GIFs from the GIF searcher from Discord or any embeds.
