####Steps to reproduce:
- Manage Roles permission is described as Members with this permission can create new roles and edit/delete roles lower than this one 
- In reality it works for all roles lower than the highest role the user has even if that higher role does not have Manage Roles permission 
- Either the description should be fixed or the permission should be made to work as described 
- Steps 
- Create 3 roles A, B and C, A above B and B above C 
- Make sure only the role C has the Manage Roles permission 
- Give roles A and C to a user

####Expected result:
No roles should be editable by that user
####Actual result:
Roles B and C are editable
