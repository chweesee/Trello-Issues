Reported by YourMCGeek#1692

####Steps to reproduce:
- Click on someone when playing a game (I've tested with Rocket League and Ghost Recon Wildlands) 
- Click on the game title to bring up the separate page showing the game, asking if you want to follow it or join the server 
- Observe the server not being there

####Expected result:
The official server should be shown to join, like Rainbow 6
####Actual result:
The official server doesn't show, just the option to follow
####Client settings:
Canary 39968
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64

### This bug seems to have been approved while it had the question mark (at least to all I've found) and I believe this to be invalid as per:
- Rocket league's Rich presence is unofficial (provide by mod called Alpha Console)
- Tom Clancy games use the wrong name than Discord expects as it doesn't include the "Tom Clancy's ...." At the start.
