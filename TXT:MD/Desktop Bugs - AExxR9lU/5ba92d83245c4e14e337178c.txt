####Steps to reproduce:
- Make a Discord RichEmbed in a bot 
- Set the title/description 
- Italicize the title/description by adding "*" around the phrase 
- Make the bot send the RichEmbed

####Expected result:
The message is supposed to be fully shown without anything clipping or cut off on the side.
####Actual result:
The italicized description/title in the richembed is cut off on the right side.
