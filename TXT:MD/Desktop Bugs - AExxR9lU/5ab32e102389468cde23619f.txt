### Can reproduce.
CR; Windows 10 Pro x64 Fall Creators Update, Discord Canary Build 12458. Take a look at my gif, it'll make more sense. (Although there is a "Download" arrow in the top right, I was still able to reproduce on 12458)

### Cannot reproduce. The emoji modal doesn't open via the right click menu, period. It shows a list in the contextual menu instead. I can only open the modal by clicking on the emoji icon.
