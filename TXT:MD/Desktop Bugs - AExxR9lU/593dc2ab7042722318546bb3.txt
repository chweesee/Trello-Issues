####Steps to reproduce:
- Make a new server without putting an icon, generating a placeholder text one 
- Go to Server Settings 
- Change the name to have random strings of the following characters: ( ) & \* # $ @ !

####Expected result:
The server icon preview displays as normal
####Actual result:
The server icon displays the characters over the background, and even over the preview circle
####Client settings:
Canary 0.0.157
####System settings:
