####Steps to reproduce:
- iOS: Block a user. 
- Press the three dots or press and hold on their name to bring up the user settings menu. 
- Press "Start Voice Call" or "Start Video Call". 
- The call popup will appear and the blocked user will receive the "x started a call" and will be able to join the call. 
- Pressing "Redail" before the person joins will physically ring the blocked user. 
- Desktop: Block a user. 
- Click "Start Voice Call". 
- The blocked user will receive a system notification that x started a call (if enabled). 
- The call will not ring at all but will allow you to click "Join Call" and fully interact with them.

####Expected result:
The call should fail because you have them blocked and they are no longer technically on your friends list.
####Actual result:
The call verifies and then connects to the user on the other end even though you have blocked them.
####Client settings:
TestFlight 2.2.1 (2236) & Discord Canary 0.0.185 (9856)
####System settings:
iPhone 8 on iOS 11.2.2 & MacBook Pro (late 2013) on MacOS 10.12.1
