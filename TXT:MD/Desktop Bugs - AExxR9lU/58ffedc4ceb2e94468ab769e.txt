####Steps to reproduce: 
- Be in a server where you can see at least 2 channels and are not the owner 
- Mention a channel that you can see in one of the other channels that you can send messages in 
- Send the message when you can still see the channel 
- Change the permissions / make it so that you can no longer see the channel you mentioned (or have someone else do it for you) 
- Click on the mention for the channel 

####Expected result:
 It should either give an error or do nothing 
####Actual result:
 The click takes you to the channel (makes it visible) and you can read back to a certain point and then it just stops loading messages completely 
####System settings:
 Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Latest Canary
