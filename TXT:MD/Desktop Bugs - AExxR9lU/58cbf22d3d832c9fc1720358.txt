####Steps to reproduce: 
- Open your user settings 
- Go to the section "Streamer Mode" 
- Enable it 
- Click "Keybind settings" *below the checkbox* 
- When it says "Streamer mode enabled" **RIGHT**click the purple button once. Then **LEFT**click "Done" 

####Expected result:
1. Keybind menu does not exist and 
2. It would close the settings menu.
 
####Actual result:
  Beside the fact that the keybinds menu does not normally exist in the web app, the UI is completely frozen (it still highlights the buttons) and you can only get out by page reload. 

####System settings:
 Linux Chrome Web App

### This only happens with the web app. Thats what wasn't made clear. - Jared on 2017-07-31T23:00:54.637Z

### So, this actually isn't a bug. It's a bug of a bug. The actual bug that needs to be fix is that you can access the keybind menu in the web app. - Jared on 2017-10-25T23:08:41.605Z
