Reported by Q__Q#0489

####Steps to reproduce:
- Launch Starcraft II (or tested game) 
- Go into the Settings > Games Activity Menu on Discord 
- If user has played Starcraft II before, Discord won't tracking the Verified game in the added games list. 
- User will have to manually add the game in order for the Playing Status to change, but it will be unverified and user will have duplicated games on Added Games list 
- (Has been repro'd on different games, like Sims 4.)

####Expected result:
Discord is able to track Starcraft II is launched and as a verified game.
####Actual result:
Starcraft II is untrackable and user has to manually add the game to change Playing Status. Also unverified.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.164
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home 64 bit
