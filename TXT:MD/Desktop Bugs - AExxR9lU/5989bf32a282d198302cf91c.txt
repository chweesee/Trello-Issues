####Steps to reproduce:
- Step1: Open a file in a browser of your choice (smaller than 8mb) 
- Step1\_2: example image which is triggering the bug for me and some other people: <http://konachan.com/image/2f16ff40220dda6a836a53dd01b2ceef/Konachan.com%20-%20240890%20animal_ears%20aqua_eyes%20blush%20catgirl%20dress%20final_fantasy%20final_fantasy_xiv%20flowers%20gray_hair%20maid%20miqo%27te%20short_hair%20signed%20tail%20yana_mori.jpg> 
- Step3: Rightclick on the image you want to upload 
- Step4: Select "Copy Image" 
- Step6: Paste the image into discord 
- Step7: It gives off a "file too powerful" error despite the file being too small 
- Alternative: Download the image to your desktop and then upload the file directly works as intended (no "File too powerfull" error)

####Expected result:
If the file is smaller than 8MB, you should be able to upload it just fine
####Actual result:
Some files from the cache can't be uploaded despite being <8MB of size. This only happens for very specific files. Uploading files directly as a file from your PC works as intended (even with the same file)
####Client settings:
If only there was an easy way to check it... But according to my extensive "researches" its Desktop Canary 163 and Desktop Stable 297
####System settings:
Windows 10 Education - Version 1703

2940

### for some reason copying from chrome more than doubles the file size of the image in question, placing it over the 8MB limit
