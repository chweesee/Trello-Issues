####Steps to reproduce:
- Have an alt or friend create a voice channel that you do not have permission to view and create an invite to that channel 
- Use the invite (click it when pasted in chat or input it through "join a server") 
- Observe

####Expected result:
The server should show without the voice channel (since you don't have permission to view it)
####Actual result:
The voice channel shows and allows you to create an invite to it if that permission is not disallowed
