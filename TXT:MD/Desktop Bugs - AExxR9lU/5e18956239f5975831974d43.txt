####Steps to reproduce:
- Mute a category with read or unread messages in the channel(s). 
- select any length of time. 
- observe.

####Expected result:
the category should be grayed out as would a muted channel.
####Actual result:
the category name is still as it would be and the category is unmuted; on desktop and ios you're required to mute the category a second time.
####Client settings:
