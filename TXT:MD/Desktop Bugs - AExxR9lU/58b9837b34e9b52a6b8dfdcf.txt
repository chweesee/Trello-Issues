### Checked on canary build 7256:

I can no longer reproduce this myself. Closing the DM removes the calling noise and popup. If you re-open the DM conversation (through search) and the other person is still calling the calling noise will restart and the popup will show itself again. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-11-13T14:40:13.415Z
