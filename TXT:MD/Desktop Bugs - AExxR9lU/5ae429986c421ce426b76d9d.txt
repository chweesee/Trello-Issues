### Not a Discord bug; This is a bug in Windows 1803 with all applications that do not utilize the native titlebar. This bug also occurs with e.g. Spotify

### Can reproduce. I believe this issue is specific to the lastest Windows version, 1803. Contrary to RME's comment I've always had an issue with Spotify on Windows so I believe this is something new. - Mike Nisbet on 2018-05-13T10:28:03.612Z

### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Pro x64 Version 1803 (Build 17134.48) - Discord Canary (Build 15268).  Regardless of whether this is a Windows bug or not, this is extremely disruptive as it means you accidentally minimize, close and maximize the window behind Discord rather than Discord itself.  Has lead to me closing quite a few programs I didn't want to.

### Asked a couple people if they can reproduce this on 1803, and they are unable. Also haven't heard any complaints about it for a while.. So it's probably fixed.

IF ITS NOT, YELL AT ME IN MY DMS, KTHX <3
