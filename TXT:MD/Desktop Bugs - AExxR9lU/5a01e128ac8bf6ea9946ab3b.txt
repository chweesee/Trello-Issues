### Can reproduce.
Works with screensharing with Application Window, and choosing Chrome for me too (seems like the Chrome one is Aero specific), Windows 7 Pro x64 | Canary 31115

### Can reproduce.
It is not necessary to share a monitor first, just Discord's window. The border flashes between the Aero inactive window, not necessarily white. Discord PTB 34850; Windows 7 Professional, Aero theme.
