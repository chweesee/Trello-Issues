Reported by Mauve Ode Iffier#6602

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to settings -> Activity Feed. 
- Find a game that you have never followed before. (For me, I used AdventureQuest 3D, and I am quite sure not a lot of people have it followed before.) 
- Follow it. 
- Exit settings, then head to Activity.

####Expected result:
I see all news of games I followed.
####Actual result:
Only games that I have followed before shows up.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 34565
####System settings:
OS X El Capitan 10.11.6
