Reported by SuperSajuuk#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Task Manager. 
- Open Discord. 
- Find a server with unread messages. 
- Click a channel which has unread messages (even if there are none there). 
- Observe memory usage in Task Manager.

####Expected result:
Going to any channel would keep memory at nominal levels of 250MB.
####Actual result:
Even if you don't mark the channel read, clicking unread channels increases memory by 8-10MB for every message that was posted into the channel. This continues until your client crashes.
####Client settings:
Canary 0.0.224 (Build 28412)
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro (64-bit), Creators Update (v1709, Build 16299.547)

### This issue has been fixed as of Discord Canary Build 28421 by SEAPUNK. He confirmed that it was an issue that all clients were having in the past few weeks, which the fix was reverted. 

I've checked the fix as SEAPUNK confirmed that it was out, and I can no longer reproduce as of Discord Canary Build 28421 on Windows 10 Home x64 (Version 1809).

Leaving this comment so that Dabbit / Icy can decide what they want to do about this ticket. - Ghoul on 2018-11-27T04:14:55.350Z
