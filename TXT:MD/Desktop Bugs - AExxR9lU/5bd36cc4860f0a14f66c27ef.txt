Reported by Aeria#9096

####Steps to reproduce:
- Set your language to German 
- Rightclick a Server 
- Observe

####Expected result:
Long Strings like "Hide Muted Channels" wrap into a new line, like e.g the message rightclick modal already does
####Actual result:
Long Strings are displayed with a "...", making it hard to understand what the option means
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 26991
####System settings:

### This also happens in the Server Menu Dropdown, User Seetings, if you right click yourself ("Deafen") or rightclick to mute a group (important since some languages have name first, then verb; while English has verb first, then name -> "Mute Group..."). Ignore my before note, wrong report.
