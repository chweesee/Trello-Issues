Reported by LigH#3575

####Steps to reproduce:
- use a server with many channels so it is probable that you have to scroll through the channel list when an unread message appears 
- when an unread message outside the displayed range appears, the "New Unread Messages" button appears 
- click it to scroll the channel list to the farthest channel with unread messages, up or down

####Expected result:
When the channel list scrolled, the button should disappear immediately
####Actual result:
It does not disappear reliably after scrolling, often only after clicking any channel
####Client settings:
Release Channel: stable, Build Number: 38214, Version Hash: 7efb0bfcaa94eea2572c0f36d27cf5f8c789e6eb
####System settings:
Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 (Build 7601) German
