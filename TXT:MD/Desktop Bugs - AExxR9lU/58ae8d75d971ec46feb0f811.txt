####Steps to reproduce: 
- click on the first message to edit (also im pretty sure it has to be in the middle of all the messages not the most recent message) 
- then while still in edit for the first message click on a message right above that one to edit 
- then mention someone. 

####Expected result:
 for it to let you see the entire mention list of users. 
####Actual result:
 it cuts the user mentions list short. Settings: Win 7 x64 discord canary
