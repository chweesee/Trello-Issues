[Archived] Removing permissions while in a hidden channel still allows messages to be seen. (https://trello.com/c/LPxl0E92)

P2: Fix can wait a while

Reported by Mr.Caleb#8593

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Have 2 different accounts using Canary and any other platform 
- Give the canary account access to manage channels 
- give the canary account a role that grants access to a hidden channel, then on the canary account, open the channel and leave it open. 
- Remove the canary accounts role that granted the secret channel but keep the manage channels permission. 

####Expected result:
 The channel will vanish and the user currently viewing something they don't have access to will be sent to the default channel. 
####Actual result:
 The user will still be able to see the channel contents, read new messages but not reply to anything. As soon as they click out of the channel, it'll vanish. 
####System settings:
 Win10 Latest Canary (No I didn't use BetterDiscord for this bug)
