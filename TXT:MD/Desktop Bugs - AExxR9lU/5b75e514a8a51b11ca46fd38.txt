Reported by aosync#3115

####Steps to reproduce:
- Be in a text channel 
- Send a message containing : <(replace by an asterisk)(replace by embeddable link, a link that should normally makes an embed)(replace by an asterisk)>

####Expected result:
An italic link should be sent, and no embed because it is escaped
####Actual result:
The sent message looks like (replace by asterisk)(the embeddable link)(replace by asterisk) but the link is not clickable (not in blue), not in italic and the link escaping chars <> are gone (wtf ?). It seems like the link escaping chars <> have escaped the markdown chars (which they shouldn't) and the clickability of the link at the same time (which it shouldn't also)
