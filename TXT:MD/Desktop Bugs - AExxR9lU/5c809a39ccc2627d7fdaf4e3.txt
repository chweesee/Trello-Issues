[Archived] users and the server owner with audit logs entries can't be used as a filter if they don't have a role that enables them to make logged actions (https://trello.com/c/Fv72UAmd)

P3: Will get fixed eventually

Reported by J1#0088

####Steps to reproduce:
- open server settings in a server you own then go to Audit logs 
- find a user that has some entries then remove all roles from them 
- reopen Audit logs then click on filter by user 
- try searching for the user you removed the roles from and observe 
- this also happen if you remove all roles from yourself even though you're the owner and able to make logged changes

####Expected result:
you should be able to search for the user with Audit logs entries since that's what filter by user is there for
####Actual result:
it doesn't show users without roles or even the owner if they don't have roles but have logged entries
