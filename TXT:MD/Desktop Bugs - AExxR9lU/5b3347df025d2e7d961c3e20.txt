[Archived] When you move the slider in the right click menu of Voice & Video settings, if your mouse goes outside the context menu it will immediately close and the slider position won't save (https://trello.com/c/z9frcSUw)

P3: Will get fixed eventually,

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Right click the cog icon that you usually click when you want to go to user settings 
- In the context menu, hover over Voice & Video 
- Two slidebars will appear, grab one of them with your mouse 
- Move the slider to the maximum (either right or left) and continue sliding until the mouse goes out of the context menu

####Expected result:
The context menu isn't supposed to close until you release your mouse, and even if this is the intended behavior, the slidebar should've at least saved its position to where it was before it closed
####Actual result:
The part of the context menu containing the slidebars closes as soon as the mouse goes out of the menu, and when you reopen it, you notice that the slidebar got reset to initial position
####Client settings:

####System settings:
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Asus Netbook F551C, Intel Core i3 64bits
