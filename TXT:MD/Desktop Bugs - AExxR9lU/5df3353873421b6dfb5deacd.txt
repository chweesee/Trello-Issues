Reported by Ura Yukimitsu#7045

####Steps to reproduce:
-  Set your keyboard locale to French (fr) AZERTY  
- Write a message and add for example a waiting grave accent  with alt gr+7 
- Send the message with enter

####Expected result:
The accent should be added at the end of the message before the message is sent
####Actual result:
The message is sent without the accent and the chat box now has a line break instead of being empty
####Client settings:
Desktop Canary 51279
