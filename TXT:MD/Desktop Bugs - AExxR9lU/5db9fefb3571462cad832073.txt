####Steps to reproduce:
- Stream Tales of Vesperia with Go Live 
- Tab over to Discord(which minimizes Vesperia) 
- Wait a few seconds 
- Stream goes from "Stream Paused" to glitchy video

####Expected result:
Stream should stay in "Stream Paused" until returning to the game
####Actual result:
"Stream Paused" becomes an extremly glitchy video only of the game. No audio. Returns to normal on tab in to game.
