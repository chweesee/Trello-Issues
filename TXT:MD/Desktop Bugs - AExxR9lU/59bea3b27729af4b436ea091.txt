####Steps to reproduce:
- On any text channel, send a message with 4 lines separated by new lines such that lines 1 and 3 begin with formatted text and line 2 ends with a period 
- Edit message into anything with a small codeblock in it (single backticks)

####Expected result:
Message is edited as per normal
####Actual result:
Formatted part of line 3 in previous message appears at the beginning of the line that contains the codeblock in the edited message until you exit and reenter the channel.

CNR with these steps, but it appears when editing a message by boldening a word with Markdown, saving, then editing again by boldening a preceding comma; the said boldened word will be duplicated; Windows 7 Pro 64bits (build 7601) w/ Desktop Canary 30291
