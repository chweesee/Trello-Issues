####Steps to reproduce:

- Leave the server where the channel belongs to without leaving the channel where you mentioned that channel 
- Click on it 
- Observe the console 
- OR 
- Ask someone to send a "Copy link" link to you to a server you are not part of. (channel wont work)

### Can reproduce.
Canary 39968/W10 Pro. Still happens, probably higher priority now that people use Copy Link imo (any invalid link causes the websocket reset)
