Reported by SuperSajuuk#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Task Manager. 
- Open Discord. 
- Find a server with unread messages. 
- Click a channel which has unread messages (even if there are none there). 
- Observe memory usage in Task Manager.

####Expected result:
Going to any channel would keep memory at nominal levels of 250MB.
####Actual result:
Even if you don't mark the channel read, clicking unread channels increases memory by 8-10MB for every message that was posted into the channel. This continues until your client crashes.
####Client settings:
Canary 0.0.226 (Build 30317)
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro (64-bit), Creators Update (v1709, Build 16299.547)

### Just to update: the code that caused the memory leak was live for less than 24 hours and was pulled ~2 weeks ago. We're continuing to work on this problem though because we'd like to fix the underlying problem. - Joey Baker on 2019-01-11T18:46:05.386Z


### We're continuing to work on the underlying issue, but this is no longer happening on any of the clients, so I'm going to close this. - Joey Baker on 2019-01-14T19:08:30.176Z

### **Additional Information:**
I've talked with Icy regarding this ticket. This was allowed to be re-opened which is an exception even though it was Verified Fixed and archived.

When this bug gets fixed again, and it lands in Verified Fixed. Instead of the 30 days with no activity then archive, we will be doing **60** days instead. This was agreed upon. - Ghoul on 2019-02-26T21:36:25.374Z
