Reported by Ene#3002

####Steps to reproduce:
- Right-click on a user to open their options menu 
- See that the arrows on "Invite to Server", "Roles", or "Move To" are more to the right if they have enough entries to create a scroll bar

####Expected result:
Arrows positioning are not affected by the scroll bar and stay aligned at all times
####Actual result:
Arrows appear not aligned if one of the sections has a scroll bar while another does not
####Client settings:

####System settings:
