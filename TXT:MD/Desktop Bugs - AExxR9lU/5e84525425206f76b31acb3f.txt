**Short Description:** If someone else (or you on another client) deletes the template, it will not update on the other client's end, rendering them unable to change anything template-related
**Steps to reproduce:**
- Create a template
- Have someone else, or a browser client, delete the template
- Attempt to sync, delete, or modify the template

**Expected Results:** The client will update the current server's template settings (i.e. there being none) and you'll have to create another
**Actual Results:** The client will only get this information on a reload, leading to "Unknown guild template" errors
**Client Settings:** Canary 56783
**System Settings:** Windows 10 64-Bit (10.0.18363)
