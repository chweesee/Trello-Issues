####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Discord 
- Turn hardware acceleration off 
- Restart discord

####Expected result:
Discord should not be sluggish and perform like with the previous electron version
####Actual result:
Discord is sluggish, animations are slow, loads are slow. It does perform like normal when the developer-tab is open.
####Client settings:
Desktop Canary, Build 25434
####System settings:
Ubuntu 18.04
