Reported by Casper#9999

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to e.g. Fortnite in Canary Guest Mode using links in desktop-announcements 
- Press the Home-button in top-left corner 
- Observe the continue-button

####Expected result:
The continue-button is supposed to be a bit higher up, so the tooltip is correct positioned and the text under as well.
####Actual result:
The text under is too close the button and the tooltip is too high up = the button is too far down.
####Client settings:

####System settings:
