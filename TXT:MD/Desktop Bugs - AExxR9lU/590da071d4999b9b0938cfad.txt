Reported by Kristoffer#3299

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Create some roles or use existing roles (in this case, I made `Role 1`,`Role 2`, and `Role 3`) 
- Go to the channel permissions (`Edit Channel` Button > Permissions) 
- Add the roles (don't change any permissions yet untill you add all the roles you will use) 
- Grant or deny (a) permission/s for all the roles (they could be different permissions for each role) 
- Click the `Save Changes` Button 
- Go to the Audit Logs 

####Expected result:
 It will say ` Granted a permission for Role 1` `Granted a permission for Role 2` and `Granted a permission to Role 3` 
####Actual result:
 It all says `Granted a permission for Role 3` 
####System settings:
