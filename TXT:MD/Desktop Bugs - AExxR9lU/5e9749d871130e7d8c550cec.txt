####Steps to reproduce:
- In a public server, make sure you have a channel set in Server Settings > Overview to be a "mod only" channel for official Discord updates.  
- Turn that channel into an Announcement Channel. 
- Go back to Server Settings > Overview and observe.

####Expected result:
The channel should not be able to be turned into an announcement channel, and should pop a similar modal same to the delete channel dialog. The channel should stay set in Server Settings.
####Actual result:
The channel is gone from Server Settings > Overview and can't be selected, therefore turning off the mandatory updates Discord requires for public channels.
####Client settings:
