####Steps to reproduce:
- Have someone blocked so their messages will not be shown 
- Have them link you a twitch stream (possibly other media also)

- Click play on the stream and imidiatly close the blocked message

####Expected result:
The stream either plays or closes and the message is hidden again
####Actual result:
A softcrash of discord that reloads UI and then recconects to server (sometimes I also got some error messages but I can't 100% reproduce them)

### Can reproduce.
CR, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Asus Netbook F551C, Intel Core i3 64bits, Discord Canary build 6257. It does only happen if you hide the blocked message BEFORE the video is fully loaded.

### Can reproduce.
Discord Canary Build 6338 Windows 10 x64, Fall Creators Update . I managed to get it to work the second I hit play. When the stream went to load an ad, it crashed my Discord. Very buggy indeed.
