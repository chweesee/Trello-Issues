####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a user with two or more integrations (Twitter, Twitch, etc) 
- Go to their profile by right clicking so the User Info tab is shown

####Expected result:
Show the Integrations with two columns so only one or two is shown per row.
####Actual result:
Firefox pushes all of the Integrations to the left side so you would have to scroll up/down to see the rest.
####Client settings:
Release Channel: stable, Build Number: 17627, Version Hash: d3e3f2c3d99299b0fb35f08a64252761d68ed06d
####System settings:

### I can still reproduce on Canary 18051 using Firefox 63.0a1 (2018-07-02) (64-bit). If you use 80 or 90% zoom you can see the bug. This is caused by the massive scroll which is broken on Firefox. 

But if you zoom in to 110 or 125%. It looks fine. Moving to user reported bugs for verification. - Tarek on 2018-07-02T17:48:24.418Z
