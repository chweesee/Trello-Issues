####Steps to reproduce:
- To test this, find a "real" gift that's already been redeemed by someone else, copy the link.

- Send it on a text channel, somewhere where you can't be interrupted. 

- After sending the link, go to the user settings. 

- Change your language to something else. 

- After that, go back to the text channel where you sent the link of the "real" gift. 

- Observe.

####Expected result:
Nothing happens, the "real" gift link still appears as expected.
####Actual result:
The "real" gift link becomes an empty, grey (or black?) rectangle.
####Client settings:
Desktop Canary 37253
####System settings:
