####Steps to reproduce:
- This problem started yesterday; it worked properly in the past. 
- Move the cursor over someone's name (in a chat channel) 
- Tap lightly with two fingers on the trackpad, or right-click with the mouse

####Expected result:
A Discord-specific context menu should appear with items including "Profile" and "Mention"
####Actual result:
The context menu appears for 0-50 ms and then disappears. (Sometimes this happens so quickly that it seems nothing happe

### Can reproduce.
This issue is not Linux or OSX specific, it's UNIX specific. This also probably happens due to the way UNIX systems handle input, this issue also does not happen under Windows 10 1809 with Firefox 65.0.1 on the Discord version I reproduced this bug on under Fedora 29. Please upscale this issue from low priority though, it makes using Discord in a browser nigh impossible and very irritating.
