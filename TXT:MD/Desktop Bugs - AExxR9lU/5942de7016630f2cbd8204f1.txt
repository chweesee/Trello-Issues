####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a discord server you manage. 
- Create a new text channel. 
- Make it so everyone cannot read or send messages. 
- Create a invite link to that channel. 
- On a new account accept the invite link.

####Expected result:
You should join the server and only see the channels you have permission to see.
####Actual result:
When you join the server you can see the hidden channels name along with the “load more messages” button that's infinitely pressable.
####Client settings:
Discord Stable Web
####System settings:
Mac OSX Sierra: Google Chrome 59.0.3071.86
