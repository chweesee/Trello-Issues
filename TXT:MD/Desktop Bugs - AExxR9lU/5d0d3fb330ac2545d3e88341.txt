####Steps to reproduce:Go into a group call: 
- click on the share screen button, wait for it to load (loads 99% of the time, but others are experiencing issues.) 
- wait for someone of your group to screenshare at the same time 
- result: sometimes freezes and screenshares must be turned of for it to work again.

####Expected result:
I don't think it's supposeed to freeze, so: basically, it should not freeze and you should be able to screenshare 2 pep.
####Actual result:
It sometimes glitches and freezes, after the freeze it might have trouble loading again.
