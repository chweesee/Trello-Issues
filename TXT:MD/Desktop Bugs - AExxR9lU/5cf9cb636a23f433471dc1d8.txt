####Steps to reproduce:
- Call someone on discord 
- Make sure you're the only one in the call (aka if they didn't answer) 
- Click the [X] next to their name on dms to remove them from your dms (with yourself still in the call) 
- go to your friends list 
- go back to your dms with them again by clicking on their profile 
- Notice that there is a call still running with no one in it (which you can rejoin by clicking the blue text too) -

####Expected result:
When you remove them from your dms, it should simply end the call.
####Actual result:
The text "[User] started a call. - Join the call" stays there even though there is no one in the call.
