####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a message from any user 
- Copy share message link 
- Block the user 
- Paste the link in any chat and click it

####Expected result:
I've been told that message links are still supposed to work even if the author of the message is a user you've blocked
####Actual result:
Clicking the link only jumps to channel, it doesn't scroll to message. If the link was posted in the same channel than the blocked message, clicking the link does absolutely nothing
####Client settings:
Canary 17800 on Google Chrome version 67.0.3396.87
####System settings:
Macbook Pro Retina 15-inch Mid 2015, OS X El Capitan 10.11.6
