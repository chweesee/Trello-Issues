Short Description: Canary is restarting randomly
Steps to Reproduce: None really, it happens randomly. I haven't noticed a pattern.
Last restart happened when I tried to switch channels on a small (<100 member) server. Nothing remarkable was in the other channel except for a couple of pictures taken from a phone
Expected Result: Not restarting
Actual Result: Canary closes, but is still on the task bar. If you click it, it doesn't open. If you start it from the notification area (by the clock), it opens.

Note: I don't know if it happens to everyone at the same time, my last one was 7/30, 1700 GMT. Canary, Win10(edited)
