- Be mentioned in a message that has over 50 lines (I pinged my main with my alt to test this)

- Go to the recent mentions, and click on the 50+ lines mention.

####Expected result:
You should be led to the top of the message, where your pinged message starts.

You are led to the middle of the message instead.
