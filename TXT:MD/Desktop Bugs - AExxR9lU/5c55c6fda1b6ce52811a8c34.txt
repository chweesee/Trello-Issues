####Steps to reproduce:
- it is necessary to upload a random GIF 
- then open it in full screen 
- right click 
- copy the link 
- remove the full screen 
- send the link 
- check if the link has no resizing images (? width = 1214 & height = 683 (at the end))   
- contemplate the horror

####Expected result:
put the GIF correctly
####Actual result:
this gives us a GIF with "parasite"
