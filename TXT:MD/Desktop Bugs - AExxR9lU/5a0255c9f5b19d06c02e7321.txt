[Archived] You can bypass the "Something is wrong" screen (it asks you to verify your phone number, for whatever reason) by clicking on a notification, and it essentially softlocks your account. You cannot leave any servers, or DM any of your friends, etc. You'll recieve a message asking you to verify your account - even if It's already verified. (https://trello.com/c/hLValBN9)

High,
P3: Will get fixed eventually

Reported by Jake#7066

####Steps to reproduce:
- Once you are at the "Something has gone wrong" screen, recieve a notification from a DM or a server you are in. 
- Click it, and you'll be able to bypass that screen, but functionality is completely limited. Step

####Expected result:
You should not be able to bypass the 'account lock 'screen.
####Actual result:
You will not be able to leave any servers, or message any friends, etc. It will constantly ask you to verify your account, etc. You will need to completely restart discord to get out of this state.
