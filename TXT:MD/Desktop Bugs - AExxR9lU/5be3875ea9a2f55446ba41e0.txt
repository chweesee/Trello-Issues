####Steps to reproduce:
- Post the link/uri in the notes below 
- Click on it 
- For all I know, it only works on desktop windows.

####Expected result:
It is not supposed to do anything. I made this purposefully.
####Actual result:
It creates an error message on your screen that you can not exit unless you completely exit Discord's process.
####Client settings:
Desktop Canary, 27545
####System settings:
Microsoft Windows 10 Home 1803, OS Build 17134.345
