####Steps to reproduce:Use 100% zoom and look at a channel where you have a mention indicator (works better if between 1 and 9) 
- Change your zoom to 90% and observe.

####Expected result:
The counter should be at the centre of the red square.
####Actual result:
The counter is slightly moved to the bottom.
####Client settings:

####System settings:

### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Pro x64 - Canary 22036, although I suspect there is not much the devs can do about it, at that scale it is hard to center letters and make them distinguishable with so few pixels
