####Steps to reproduce:
- Make the window as small as you can (or just small in general) 
- Open the server Nitro Boosting page, server notifications page, or Go Live page. (Usually any large popup)

####Expected result:
The user would be able to scroll down and read the information or the UI would scale it down.
####Actual result:
The window opened will be cut off and not scaled down.

### This is not a bug as per https://trello.com/c/sXwCyX1y - modals aren't supposed to change their size when the window size changes
