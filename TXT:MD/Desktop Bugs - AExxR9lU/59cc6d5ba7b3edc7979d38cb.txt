####Steps to reproduce:
- Pick a server which you are missing a permission, such as Send Messages 
- Click Edit Channel (the gear) 
- Go to the Permissions section 
- For any role, click the check (attached) next to the permission you don't have.

####Expected result:
It gives you a message saying you can't grant a permission you don't have, or it actually grants the permission
####Actual result:
It gives the attached message, saying you can't deny the permission because you will lose it.
