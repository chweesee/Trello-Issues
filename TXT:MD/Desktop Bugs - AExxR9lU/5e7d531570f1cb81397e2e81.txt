**Steps to reproduce:**
- Click "Test" on the Noise Suppression panel.
- Have a keybind set to toggle mute or deafen upon activation.
- Activate that keybind while testing your mic in the Noise Suppression panel.
**Expected Results:** Your keybinds regarding mute/deafen toggle shouldn't work.
**Actual Results:** Your keybinds still work, which defeats the purpose of being automatically deafened when clicking "Test".
