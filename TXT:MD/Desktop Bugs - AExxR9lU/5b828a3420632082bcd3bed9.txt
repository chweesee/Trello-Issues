####Steps to reproduce:
- Go into a DM with a user you can start a Voice Call with (or just make an empty Group DM) 
- Start a Voice Call 
- Click on the Connection Info button in the voice bar to your bottom left 
- Observe the bottom sentence

####Expected result:
The suggestion should not appear as manually changing a DM Voice Call's region is no longer possible
####Actual result:
The impossible suggestion is still present
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.211, Build 22587
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home 64-bit (v1709)
