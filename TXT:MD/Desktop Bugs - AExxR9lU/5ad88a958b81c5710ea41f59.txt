Reported by Ene#0808

####Steps to reproduce:
- Search "In: {channel}" in a channel that has users with a coloured role (so it's easily noticeable) 
- Select Relevant to go back in message history easier

####Expected result:
All users with results are cached into the client
####Actual result:
Client only shows already cached users and doesn't cache any that weren't cached before
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.204, Build 13912
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home 64-bit (v1709)

### **Extension to this issue**
When using the search with the `from:` filter and typing any username, you sometimes won't see any user suggestions in the list to autocomplete. Doesn't happen with all users and not every time, restarting the app might help. Probably happens because the users are not cached so far.
