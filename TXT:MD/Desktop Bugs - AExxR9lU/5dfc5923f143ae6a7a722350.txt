####Steps to reproduce:

- Paste that link into the text box in someone's DMs 
- Delete everything after the "(at)me/" and replace it with a channel ID from a server 
- Send that message link 
- Click on that message link 
- Observe

####Expected result:
The Discord client should be stuck on a loading screen, unable to load anything.
####Actual result:
You will be brought to the server in the channel you specified, but the DMs drawer stays there.
