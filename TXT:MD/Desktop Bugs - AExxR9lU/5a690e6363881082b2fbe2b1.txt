Reported by rauf#3260

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a private channel that people don't have access to. 
- Find someone to test ping. 
- Try to ping with discrim included. ex. @turkey#1234 
- May or may not work. 
- Now try without discrim. ex. @turkey

####Expected result:
2nd mention shouldn't resolve as the user is not in the channel, like the 1st mention
####Actual result:
2nd mention resolves and shows that the user is mentioned
####Client settings:
Canary 9837
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home Fall CU x64
