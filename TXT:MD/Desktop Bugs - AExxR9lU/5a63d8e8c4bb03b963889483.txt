Reported by heatingdevice#1212

####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a message posted by a webhook 
- Click the webhook name to show the popout 
- Find the middle of it and observe cursor change

####Expected result:
The mouse should remain a pointer
####Actual result:
The cursor changes because of the "View Profile" text since the `cursor: pointer` isn't there for a webhook profile
####Client settings:
Canary build 9714
####System settings:
Arch Linux
