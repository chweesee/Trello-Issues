### Can reproduce.
repro steps need to be formatted better, but it works. | Discord Canary 0.0.163 on Win 10 x64 (Creators Update)

### Can reproduce.
managed to repro but only does this if you open the profile while the roles are being added (not when the roles are already there), as the profile expands downwards the textfield exits screen and as soon as you press a key, instead of just the profile, the whole discord goes upwards until the text field is in the viewport - Canary 0.0.163 (3801) Win10 x64 (CU)
