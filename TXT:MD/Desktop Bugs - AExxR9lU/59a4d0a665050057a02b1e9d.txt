Reported by Evie.Codes#4611

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have DMs disabled on all shared servers with someone 
- Have a previous DM with this person (not blocked!) 
- The other user pins any message.

####Expected result:
If all DMs are disabled, pins should not be possible, as it's essentially the same as blocking all DMs
####Actual result:
Notification is received for a pinned message.
####Client settings:
0.0.163
####System settings:
