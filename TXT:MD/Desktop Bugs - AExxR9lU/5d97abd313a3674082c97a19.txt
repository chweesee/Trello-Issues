Reported by Icy#9999

####Steps to reproduce:
- Run the most recent version of Discord for Windows 10 
- Head over to "User Settings" by clicking the gear in the bottom-left 
- Select "Voice & Video" under the "App Settings" category 
- Verify that a camera/broadcaster is connected (there should be at least one option on the drop-down box under "Camera" in the "Video Settings" catergory) 
- Inside the box labeled "Preview", click the button that reads "Test Video" 
- Drag the picture inside the preview into a folder or onto your Desktop 
- Note that the picture is the default picture and does not match that the box actually displays

####Expected result:
Instead, when the image under "Preview" is dragged out of the box, it should be the displayed image, not the default one
####Actual result:
I get a copy of the default picture that shows up when no video is being tested.
