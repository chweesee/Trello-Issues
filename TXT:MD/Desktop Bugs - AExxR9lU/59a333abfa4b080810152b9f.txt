### This ticket was checked during the Trello cleanup event, and is reproducible with a slight different reproduction step. So I have edited up the reproduction steps a bit for this case. Device used was WIndows 10 Pro x64 with Discord Canary Build 18226.

Because of this ticket still being able to be reproduced, I will leave it to be. - Ghoul on 2018-07-06T03:54:58.986Z
