####Steps to reproduce:
- Open dev tools (CTRL/CMD+SHIFT+I), you'll want to keep an eye out for an error that ends in " /pins 429 ()" in the coming steps 
- Open as many different channel pins as quickly as possible until you see the aforementioned error, don't close the one that's open when you see the error 
- Observe the pins box, repeat step 2 if you clicked off the pins box too fast

####Expected result:
An informative error should tell you that you are being ratelimited
####Actual result:
An infinite loading symbol appears in the pins box, implying that there is something wrong with the connection etc.
