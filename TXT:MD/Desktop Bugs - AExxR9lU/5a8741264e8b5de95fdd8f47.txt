####Steps to reproduce:
- Type any word with a punctuation in it (should not be an apostrophe) such as `l;ife`, `l;ook`, `m,ine`, `p[ine` etc 
- Attempt to correct the typo you've made

####Expected result:
The entire word should have a redline under it and should give you options to correct the typo
####Actual result:
Spellcheck treats it as two different words and only has a redline on the letters before and/or after the punctuation and only gives you option to correct those letters and not the word itself
