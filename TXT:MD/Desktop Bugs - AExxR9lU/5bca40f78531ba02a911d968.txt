Reported by AmirAmani#0102

####Steps to reproduce:
- Right Click on a server which you hasn't read new message on it 
- Click Server Mute (enable) 
- Click Server Mute again (disable)

####Expected result:
That little new message icon should've appeared next (left) to the server avatar after disabling server mute.
####Actual result:
When someone send a new message a semicircular icon appear next to the server avatar, then switch to another server, now if you click Server Mute that icon will disappear then if you click server mute again you could see there is still no icon while the message you hasn't read that new message yet. that semicircular icon wont appear unless you switch to that server which you could see a bold channel that has new message on it.
