Reported by J1#0088

####Steps to reproduce:
- go to any server that has enough channels for the scrollbar to appear 
- select a channel that's in the middle and notice where the channel you're in is placed and the scrollbar placement 
- click "ctrl + alt + â†’" twice so that you navigate to DMs and back to the server 
- observe the channels list again

####Expected result:
it shouldn't scroll the channels list up just like when manually navigating
####Actual result:
it scrolls the channels list up
####Client settings:
Canary 0.0.226 - 30296
####System settings:
Windows 10 home x64 v.1803
