### Can reproduce.
CR, Discord Canary 0.0.167 (Build 6168) on Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (Build 1607) | This will cause an infinite crash loop, only way to solve is to change your language form your phone thanks to  the "sync clients" feature

### Should be fixed. There were some bugs in new timestamp engine we wrote. - Jake Heinz on 2017-10-22T01:52:18.987Z


### Moved from User Reported Bugs to Claimed Fixed, needs Verification by Jake Heinz on 2017-10-22T01:52:30.886Z


### Can reproduce.
This issue still occurs on Discord Canary 0.0.167 (Build 6174),
Jake, the best way for it to crash is to set the language to russia and later on go to DTestesrs and then the channel "desktop-bug-reports"

### I am definitely still able to reproduce, the app gets caught in a crash loop, it sometimes even happens right after changing the language to Russian.

### Can reproduce.
just changing the lang to russian is enough to make it crash while reloading Windows 10 1709 x64, Canary build 7557

AEnterprise#4693 - Bug Bot on 2017-11-21T15:30:56.790Z


### Can reproduce.
CR on windows 10 x64 FCU and canary 7557 | seems to escalate to fully locking client, even if language is changed, forcing user to clear reinstallation
