####Steps to reproduce:
- Be in a server where at least one channel is public 
- Go to Server Settings > Roles 
- Turn off "Read Text Channels & See Voice Channels" for the `@everyone` role 
- Ensure you have permission still to view the channel 
- Look at the channel's icon

####Expected result:
A lock icon appears next to the channel as it's no longer a public channel
####Actual result:
No lock icon appears
####Client settings:
