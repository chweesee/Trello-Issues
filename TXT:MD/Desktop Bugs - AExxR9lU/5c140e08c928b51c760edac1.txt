[Archived] Expanding a blocked message that is the latest message in the channel will cause the blocked message to expand out of the view, so you need to scroll down to read it (https://trello.com/c/TXQnmMMS)

P3: Will get fixed eventually,

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go in a channel (preferably inactive) 
- Make sure you're not scrolled up in chat 
- Open the profile of the person who sent the latest message in the channel 
- Block them 
- Expand the latest blocked message

####Expected result:
When expanding the blocked message, the chat should move up enough so that it's still clipped to the bottom and you don't have to scroll down
####Actual result:
The blocked message expands offscreen at the bottom, so you need to scroll down in order to see its content
####Client settings:
Canary 29657
####System settings:
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (stock GNOME desktop env), 64-bit processor Ryzen 7 2700X
