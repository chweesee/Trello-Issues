[Archived] When upgrading from $49.99 classic to $9.99 Nitro, the tooltip on $9.99 uses the term "lower-tier", when you are actually upgrading to a higher-tier nitro. (https://trello.com/c/X14qAoYU)

P3: Will get fixed eventually,

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have the $49.99 classic nitro plan. 
- Then, go to Settings>Nitro, and hover your mouse over the $9.99 nitro option. Read the tooltip.

####Expected result:
It should say that you should let the sub expire before choosing a HIGHER TIER plan.
####Actual result:
It says that you should let the sub expire before choosing a LOWER TIER plan.
