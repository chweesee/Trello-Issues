Reported by SuperSajuuk#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Update to the latest build of Canary (37408) 
- Go to a server where you can see Server Settings, but can't modify them. 
- Make sure the server has a System Message channel set. 
- Observe the toggles.

####Expected result:
The toggles are disabled because you don't have Server Settings.
####Actual result:
They are usable even though they don't do anything due to lack of permissions.
####Client settings:
Canary 0.0.237 (Build 37408)
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro (64-bit), Creators Update (v1709, Build 16299.547)
