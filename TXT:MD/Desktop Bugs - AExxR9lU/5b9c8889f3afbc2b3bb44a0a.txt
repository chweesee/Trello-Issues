####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Discord & Media Monkey 
- Add Media Monkey as the game you're currently playing 
- Change the name of the game you're currently playing (Media Monkey to whatever) in Discord 
- Discord loses detection of Media Monkey until you click back on the Media Monkey program itself

####Expected result:
It's supposed to change the game name shown (Media Monkey) to whatever you change it to.
####Actual result:
Discord goes from the name changing to 'No Game Detected'
####Client settings:
Release Channel: stable, Build Number: 23012, Version Hash: fa2ef18a6aebe7620cedfc5bb14fea57067e1def
####System settings:
Windows 10 x64
