####Steps to reproduce: 
- open Discord on a computer running **MacOS**  
- start typing a message in the message box 
- go to edit --> emojis & symbols 
- select the male prince emoji with white skin and black hair (skin tone 1)  

####Expected result:
 emoji  automatically pastes into your message box and when you send the message, it works as expected 
####Actual result:
 emoji breaks and the prince emoji (wrong skin color) along with a strange square appear on the message box 
####System settings:
