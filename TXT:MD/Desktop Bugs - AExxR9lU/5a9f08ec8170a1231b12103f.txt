> My issue is similar to the one in the trello report. However, I am able to unmute myself if I go into my Discord Settings and toggle the settings in Voice & Video > Voice Activity and Push to Talk (Limited)
> I normally toggle between the two until I hear the unmute noise
> Or I can spam click the unmute button over and over, go into settings and then it unmutes itself???
