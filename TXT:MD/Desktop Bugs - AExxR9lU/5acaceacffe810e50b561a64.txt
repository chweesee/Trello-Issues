Reported by ahoZiorce#3115

####Steps to reproduce:
- Send a message (happens also if you aren't the author) 
- Scroll up (it happens UNLESS  the option "JUMP TO PRESENT" is visible, so if you have it, scroll down a bit until you don't see it anymore) 
- Ask someone or a bot to delete the latest message

####Expected result:
The message should be deleted and you should still be where you were before
####Actual result:
The message is deleted and you "jump back to present"
####Client settings:
Canary 13313
####System settings:
MS Windows 10 Pro x64 (v1709)
