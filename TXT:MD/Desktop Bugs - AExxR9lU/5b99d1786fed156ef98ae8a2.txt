Reported by Ene#0808

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have Developer Mode enabled in your User Settings -> Appearance (If you didn't have it enabled previously, then switch to another area of Discord after changing it before continuing the steps)  
- Send a message into a chat 
- Go back into your User Settings and disable Developer Mode 
- Exit out of your User Settings and click the three dots on the message you had sent prior and observe the "Copy ID" option still being present

####Expected result:
The Copy ID option should no longer be present on messages sent prior to disabling it
####Actual result:
The Copy ID option is still present on all past messages until you switch to another area or reload your client (this works vice-verse as well)
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.211, Build 23554
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home 64-bit (v1803)
