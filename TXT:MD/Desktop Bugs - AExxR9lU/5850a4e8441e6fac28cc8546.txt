### Works after clicking anywhere on the popup and then pressing enter \üëå

### Can reproduce.
Win 10 Pro x64 AU, Canary. Very annoying. Would also like to note that the cause of this bug is because the focus is on the message text field, not the delete form. Pressing enter still works fine, if you get to the delete modal by right clicking and message and clicking the delete message button.
