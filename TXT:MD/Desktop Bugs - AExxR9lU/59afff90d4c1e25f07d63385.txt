####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a DS filter installed, found with webcamXP Free 5.9.8.7 <http://www.webcamxp.com/download.aspx> 
- Enter Discord Voice & video settings: crash 
- Entering settings with Ctrl+Win pressed: no crash (?) 
- Uninstall the previously mentioned software, enter settings: no crash

####Expected result:
Should not crash. Corner case with this legacy filter, but maybe triggered by other similar video filters as well?
####Actual result:
Discord restarts, unable to change any voice or video settings
####Client settings:
Canary 0.0.163
####System settings:
Windows 10 (1703 Build 15063.540)
