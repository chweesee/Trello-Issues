Reported by EKW#0528

####Steps to reproduce:
- Be on firefox 
- write, in a code block, a line with multiple tabs at the beginning

####Expected result:
The indentation of each line should be proportional to the number of tabs preceding them.
####Actual result:
Regardless of the number of tabs preceding a line, the line will be displayed as being indented only once. This does not appear to be a firefox bug, as   displays tabs correctly.
####Client settings:
Firefox, stable, build number 5010
####System settings:
macOS Sierra, 10.12.3

5012
