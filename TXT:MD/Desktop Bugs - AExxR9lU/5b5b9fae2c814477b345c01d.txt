####Steps to reproduce:
- Use this: ```if (('`123')) {
        ('1⃣')(r => {
            ('2⃣')(r=> {
                ('3⃣');
            });
        });
    }``` 
- You will see that the emojis don't output correctly 
- Try to copy the 1 2 3 boxes and it will output correctly outside of the code blocks 
- If you copy from the code blocks above to VSC or Atom, it will show the text as it is, try Googling the 2 Emoji and paste it into Discord, VSC, and Atom, they will render it correctly, Discord cannot render the number emojis in code blocks but renders basically everything else 
- REMEMBER TO COPY AND REPLACE 2⃣ WITH 2️⃣

####Expected result:
Number emojis are supposed to render in code blocks, other emojis work
####Actual result:
Number emojis don't render in code blocks and frustrates the user
####Client settings:
Tested on: - Discord Canary Desktop v20088 -
####System settings:
Tested on: - Windows 10 Pro x64 1803

### Ok, regarding my last comment. It's bit incorrect. Though still not a bug

A few unicode emojis has this character http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/20e3/index.htm in the unicode characters. As you can see under the "Emoji" tab. - Tarek on 2018-07-27T23:07:24.778Z
