####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a message with 200 \`:cookie:\` directly after each other (No spaces) 
- Write some text after those cookies. 
- Send message (No warning that one exceeds the character limit). at this point the message should be just over 1600 characters long, well below the limit. 
- Additional test: edit message and remove 2 \`:cookie:\` instances, save, now the text will be displayed. 
- pastebins with examples: https://pastebin.com/6cXCTxs8 and https://pastebin.com/wnamBGcE

####Expected result:
You see 200 cookies and the message after it.
####Actual result:
You only see cookies and no additional text
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.24
####System settings:
Arch Linux (4.12.4-1-ARCH) (also tested on windows 10)

### The server doesn't see emojis like `:cookie:`, it sees them like `<:cookie:9384230483299>` instead. You're probably well over the 2k character limit with this.

However, the behavior is still odd and I can reproduce. This is probably a won't fix, but we will see. - Jared on 2017-08-07T17:32:45.274Z
