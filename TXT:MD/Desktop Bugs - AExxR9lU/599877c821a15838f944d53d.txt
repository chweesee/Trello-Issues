the bottom part of first line (for example, the end of the letter y) should appear and there is enough spacing between the lines
####Actual result:
the spacing between the lines is not enough for the bottom part to appear

### This is an ancient, well known bug. There's probably a bug already reported here but I'm just too lazy to find it. - Jared on 2017-08-21T20:40:53.341Z

### Anyway, this is a won't fix, it's just a byproduct of how the system works and it would take way too much effort to change it for a tiny benefit. - Jared on 2017-08-21T20:41:26.955Z


### This has been labeled as Won't Fix for more than a month. Archiving this ticket. - Mike Nisbet on 2017-10-17T21:20:33.593Z
