[Archived] Getting a notification (it does help if you are getting multiple notifications from the same location; someone typing repeated short messages and sending them) and going into Discord manually (so in any way aside from clicking or pressing on the notification itself) doesn’t to clear the notifications from the Notification Center. (https://trello.com/c/zmagn6Nl)

P3: Will get fixed eventually,

Reported by Nimbus#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Join a server and allow desktop notifications 
- Receive a message from the server 
- Go to the server and clear the “New Message” notification

####Expected result:
The notification should be cleared from the Notification Center
####Actual result:
The notifications stick although they were read by going into the chat. Again, clicking or pressing on the notification itself will bring you into said chat and delete the notification (as expected), but going into Discord and reading chats that pushed notifications to you do not dismiss themselves despite being read.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary, Build Number: 19429
####System settings:
