####Steps to reproduce:
- First, open any First Person Game. 
- Open ***Discord*** Build 38594 ``STABLE`` 
- Video-call someone 
- Move your mouse towards the window at the top broadcasting you and your friend, and press ``RMB``. 
- Select the "Broadcast ``[Insert Game Here]``" button provided 
- Allow any required permissions 
- Open the First Person game using ``ALT + TAB`` 
- Return to the ***Discord*** client using ``ALT + TAB``

####Expected result:
The Client should broadcast your game as usual.
####Actual result:
Due to the centralization of the mouse, the system locks in the centre of the window above the textboxes. Sometimes it then forces the use of ``CTRL+ALT+DEL`` or may Crash the Operating System on it's own, such as when playing ***Subnautica*** or ***Counter Strike: Global Offensive***.
####Client settings:
``Discord Stable Build 38594``
####System settings:
``Windows 10 Home, Version 1803 (OS Build 17134.765)``
