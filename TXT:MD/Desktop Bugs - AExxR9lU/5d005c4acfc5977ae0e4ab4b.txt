Reported by Rashaun#8467

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have someone mention you in a server that's located down your server list by at least 20 servers 
- Scroll the channel list until the server is in view with another server partly in view below it 
- Observe how the new mention banner is visible even though you can see the server 
- Try to click on the banner and see if anything happens

####Expected result:
Either banner doesn't appear or server list scrolls until it disappears after clicking it
####Actual result:
Banner appears when server is still in view and doesn't do anything when clicked
