Reported by MetalChain#6372

####Steps to reproduce: 
- In a server you do not own OR have Administrator permissions in, have a channel you can manage permissions in 
- Edit the permissions so that your individual user has permissions to manage permissions, while all other roles you have DO NOT. 
- Delete your individual  user permission profile 

####Expected result:
 You get a warning before you delete your user profile that it would revoke permissions, or the permissions tab would close out after it revokes them 
####Actual result:
 The permissions tab grays out the screen entirely after removing your user profile 
####System settings:

### Attachment removed because it didn't show the issue, it was a 'gimmick' of someone adding "more information" by screenshotting their text line. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-04-30T16:35:54.502Z


### You must also have the "Manage Channel" permission, whether it be in that channel, or in the server overall.

### Tested on latest canary as of writing:

Followed all the reproduction steps (and video) and the moment I deny myself the permission I got booted out of the permission screen normally.

This means I can no longer reproduce this bug. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-05-03T21:19:32.535Z
