### Here's what I did:

1)  Sign in with Users A and B.
2)  User A creates a server, fills it with multiple pages of spam.
3)  User B joins A's server, scrolls to the bottom.
4)  Unread messages notificator disappears.
5)  B switches active servers.
6)  A posts a new message.
7)  Unread notificator appears for B again.
8)  A deletes a bunch of messages from earlier.
9) B goes into the relevant channel.

Result: The chat remains scrolled to the bottom of the screen, unread chat notificator disappears.
