####Steps to reproduce:
- Open a user's profile and click on the three dots to open the tooltip, then observe

####Expected result:
Tooltip options text should be in a more readable colour, I believe it was white before
####Actual result:
Tooltip options text is in black, making it blend with the background and look horrific
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.195, Build 9389
####System settings:
