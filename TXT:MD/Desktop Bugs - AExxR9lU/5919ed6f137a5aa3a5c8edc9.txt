Reported by Kw1q51|v3r_Vorian#0469

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Use Focusrite Saffire Pro 24 as system output device 
- Play any audio from Discord (inculdes notifications and voice channel audio) 
- Comment: Reproducibility probably very low due to practical reasons relating to specialised hardware 

####Expected result:
 Audio from Discord plays through Output channels 1 and 2 at equal levels 
####Actual result:
 Audio only plays through Output channel 1 (Left side of stereo output) 
####System settings:
 Macbook Pro 10,1 (Retina, 15" early 2013), Mac OS X El Capitan 10.11.6, Discord Mac client v0.0.247, Focusrite Saffire MixControl 3.7, Saffire Pro 24 Firmware version 2761

### Can reproduce.
I don't know about the Focusrite Saffire Pro 24, but I do have this exact same bug with a different piece of hardware. It's all the same root cause.

### Verified. I'll leave this in the verified bugs for now, so it's public. It's also on the internal board.  - Clayton on 2017-05-19T01:13:11.053Z
