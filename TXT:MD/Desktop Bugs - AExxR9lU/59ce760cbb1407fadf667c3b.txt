####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to any channels permission 
- Choose a permission from any role that is not overwritten 
- Either allow or disallow it 
- Click save (you may see the '/' flashing) 
- Change it back to how it was (to '/') 
- It does not always work. To retry, exit the settings and retry.

####Expected result:
You are prompted to save or discard your changes
####Actual result:
You can leave, your last edit will not be saved (the warning on the bottom does not appear)
####Client settings:
Desktop Canary 0.0.164
####System settings:
Windows 10
