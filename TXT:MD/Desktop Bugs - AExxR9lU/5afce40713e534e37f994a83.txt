Reported by Fox#8000

####Steps to reproduce:
- Turn on screen share with audio 
- go to settings and change microphone input to your htc vive 
- close settings and try to speak while streaming game audio

####Expected result:
Should be able to hear both game/application audio and also whoever is speaking with the htc vive
####Actual result:
The microphone doesn’t get picked up UNLESS you are in the settings tab (which makes the streamed sound from the application choppy)
####Client settings:
Discord (regular) 0.0.301
####System settings:
Windows 10 pro x64 version 1709
