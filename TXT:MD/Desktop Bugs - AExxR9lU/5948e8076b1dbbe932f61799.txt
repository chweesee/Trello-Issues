### Now when I'm playing around with it. I tried to call someone 5 times and only once there was no sound. And that was the first time I tried to call someone. Same specsa as my approval message.

### Tested for reproduce again, as well,  on 3rd attempt I could hear the first round of sound, and then it just goes silent, while you still can see the "ring ring" animation.
