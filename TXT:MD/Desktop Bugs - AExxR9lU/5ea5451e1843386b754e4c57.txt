None

Reported by Samsamson33#0913

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open the new emoji selector 
- Scroll all the way to the bottom 
- Collapse all the categories 
- Select one of the lower categories in the sidebar (for example, flags or symbols)

####Expected result:
The category should be highlighted in the sidebar, even if it doesn't require scrolling when clicked
####Actual result:
It is not highlighted. Instead, the selector will highlight whichever category is at the top of the picker when scrolled to that point (in the case of the example image, "Food"). This is somewhat unintuitive behavior, since clicking on one category can effectively select another one.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 58858
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home 1909
