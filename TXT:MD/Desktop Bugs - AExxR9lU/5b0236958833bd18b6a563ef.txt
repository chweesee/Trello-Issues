Reported by Ene#0808

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a user with a long username (Example: IsTheCakeALieOrTheActualTruth?) post an invite 
- Delete it in Server Settings > Invites 
- Click "Join" or refresh your client so it appears as expired and observe the bottom sentence

####Expected result:
Username cuts off to allow the full sentence to appear on the invite or perhaps move the Mention button slightly up
####Actual result:
"Ask {username} for a new invite!" sentence gets pushed behind the Mention button
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.209, Build 15665
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home 64-bit (v1709)
