Reported by Tarek1337#0379

####Steps to reproduce:
- Write a message that is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord_(software)
- then post a second message with any content you want before discord software, here's an example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILoveBugHunters/Discord_(software)

####Expected result:
It shouldn't show an embed since the wikipedia page doesn't exist
####Actual result:
It shows an embed of the discordapp wikipedia page
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.185 (Build 8541)
####System settings:
