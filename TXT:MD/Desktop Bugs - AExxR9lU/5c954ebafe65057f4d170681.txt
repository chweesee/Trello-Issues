####Steps to reproduce:
- Go into lurker 
- Find someone you are not friends with and share no mutual servers with 
- Right click them 
- Invite them to a server 
- Open the DM 
- Observe how the Clyde message is not there and the DM notification is still under the home button until you click off and click back on 
- NOTE: You do receive a windows notification(if you have it enabled) for clyde's message it just doesn't appear in the DM

####Expected result:
Clyde Bot's message shouldn't be deleted and the DM notification should go away the moment you read the message
####Actual result:
Clyde Bot's message is deleted and the DM notification gets stuck until you click on and off the DM
