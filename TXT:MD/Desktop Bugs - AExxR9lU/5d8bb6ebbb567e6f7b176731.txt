####Steps to reproduce:
- Start a Call with your friends! 
- Try to show them your amazing work by trying to Screenshare 
- Regardless of Window or Application Sharing, select "Source" as the Stream Quality 
- Observe your own feed or have your DM Partner tell you what they see 
- Try to click on a different DM and back and observe it loading indefinitely

####Expected result:
You can screenshare without issues, just like 720 or 1080 settings do!
####Actual result:
Your feed will "freeze" on the first frame (or frames, it seems to "reload" and then freeze). When switching tabs, it loads indefinitely
