####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to the dev portal 
- Create, or use an existing application 
- Select the Rich Presence tab on the left 
- Scroll down to the Visualizer 
- Observe how the text is inconsistent with what's actually in the profile

####Expected result:
I would expect the text say "Mutual Servers". It's a visualizer after all
####Actual result:
The text says "Mutual Guilds"
####Client settings:
Web Stable
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64 (1803) - Firefox v61.0.2
