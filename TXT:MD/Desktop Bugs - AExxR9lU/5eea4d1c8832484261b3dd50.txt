####Steps to reproduce:Go to a channel's permission settings (in order to reproduce that bug, you need bunch of roles) 
- If the roles are enough to cover the page, add more roles. 
- Observe that section is not scrollable, which does not allow you to edit roles that is not shown on the page.

####Expected result:
You should be able to scroll down between role list. Also if you add any role, you will not be able to manage them.
####Actual result:
You can't scroll in the permission list part. The page behaves frozen. (That also happens in role list, you can't scroll down on roles in server setting)
####Client settings:
Canary Build Number: 61803
####System settings:
