Reported by Ana#0950

####Steps to reproduce:
- Step 1 Give a user a lot of roles (130+) 
- Step 2 Save and then click on the user from memberlist for userprofile.

####Expected result:
It should show you name tag, picture and priority the important roles such as leader or owner
####Actual result:
Everything is pushed up, where the lowest prioritized roles are only shown, which hides users "admin" roles and name/picture. Visual illustration : <http://i.imgur.com/nJtNCYE.png> You can't see Tarek's name/picture or even his "Red" Admin rights role. but the meaningless 1-109 roles
