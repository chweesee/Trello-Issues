####Steps to reproduce:
- Send a message containing a Trello URL, link preview should appear under the message 
- Edit the message and add <> around the Trello URL and save the edit

####Expected result:
The preview of the Trello URL disappears, like it'd with other links (you can try sending an Imgur link and then editing <> around it for example, the preview disappears)
####Actual result:
The Trello link preview stays below the message, even though the link is escaped with <> around it (which is visible if you edit/copy the message)
####Client settings:
Canary 0.0.170 (Build 6864), also happens on iOS (and possible other) platform
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro 1709 x64
