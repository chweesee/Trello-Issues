####Steps to reproduce:
- Step 1: Create a file that is exactly 8 or 50 MiB. 
- Step 2: Try to upload it to Discord.

Either the upload fails on the client and doesn't start uploading, or the server accepts the file and it uploads successfuly.
####Actual result:
The file is entirely uploaded, then the client displays an 'Upload Failed' message.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.24
####System settings:
