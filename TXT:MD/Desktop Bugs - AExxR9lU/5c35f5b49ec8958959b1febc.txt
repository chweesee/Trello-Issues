Reported by Peps#0927

####Steps to reproduce:
- The channel have 15 servers posted on it. 
- 10 of the invites Will stay grey and keep resolving until 10-20 minutes. 
- After it is resolved only the first 10 is displayed, the remaining 5 is not visible. 
- Only the desktop version is affected, it Works fine on both Android and IOS devices. 
- Around 100 user reported that they have this issue to me. 
- Installed discord on a fresh WIN10 pc, the issue is still there.

####Expected result:
It was displaying all the 15 invites a few weeks ago, without long resolving times.
####Actual result:
Invite blocks keep resolving and 5 out of 15 is not even displayed after it's resolved.
####Client settings:
Desktop Build Number: 30418
####System settings:
