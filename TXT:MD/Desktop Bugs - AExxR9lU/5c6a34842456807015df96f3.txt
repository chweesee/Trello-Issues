####Steps to reproduce:
- Load up Discord Canary, and move your cursor to where it says Acknowledgements and press it. 
- Make sure Safari is your default browser. Pressing the Acknowledgements button will lead you to   
- Once you're on that webpage, attempt to scroll up or down in the center, i.e. scrolling through the list of names in the middle of the screen, not the actual webpage. 
- Note: this doesn't happen every time. Attempt these steps a few times. It did not work for me when I directly went to the Acknowledgements page; higher success rate when going through Discord app first.

####Expected result:
The scrollbar should work fine, and you should easily be able to scroll through the list of names.
####Actual result:
The scrollbar doesn't scroll. It appears as if it freezes and doesn't allow you to scroll until you reload the page.
####Client settings:
Canary 32395; Safari 12.1
####System settings:
macOS 10.14.4
