Reported by Tarek#1337

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a keybind before the update (I had Press to mute set on mouse 4) 
- Observe how it changed to something random, and is not delete-able (It changed to "PRESS TO TALK" and to control 4, and pressing both buttons did nothing besides making the sound when unmuting)

####Expected result:
It should carry over keybind settings
####Actual result:
The action type and keybind gets messed up, and make its impossible to remove
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.214 (25434)
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (1803)
