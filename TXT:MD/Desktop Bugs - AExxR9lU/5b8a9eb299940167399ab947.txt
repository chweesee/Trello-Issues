####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure you have manage channels permission 
- Create a category with a underline formatting in its name (e.g. `__Test__`) 
- Add a channel to this category 
- Edit the channel 
- Go to permissions 
- Observe the permissions sync/not synced with category warning

####Expected result:
Underline should get escaped as all other Markdown formatting.
####Actual result:
You see the category name as underlined.
