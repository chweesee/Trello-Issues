Reported by Rage#9991

####Steps to reproduce:
- Set a very long name for a channel (It might be easier to reproduce on a smaller screen) 
- Set a topic that has more than 2 characters in it 
- Stretch your window from the left side horizontally to the right side and observe the part where the mute channel button is while stretching

####Expected result:
It gets normally truncated and not cut off
####Actual result:
Either just 3 dots appear or the topic kinda gets cut off at the button
####Client settings:
Canary 21705
####System settings:
Macbook Air, macOS Sierra 10.12.6
