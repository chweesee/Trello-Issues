####Steps to reproduce:
- Find Discord on the Process Bar 
- Hover your mouse of the Icon and a "preview" will pop up 
- Right Click the Preview 
- Observe

####Expected result:
It should open a menu saying: "Restore - Move - Size - Minimize - Maximize - Close (Alt + F4)"
####Actual result:
It just "shuts down, as in closing the preview
####Client settings:
Discord Stable, Build: 27050
