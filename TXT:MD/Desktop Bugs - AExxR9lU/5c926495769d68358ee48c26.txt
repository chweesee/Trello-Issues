####Steps to reproduce:
- You must have a debit card accepted under the billings tab in settings (Never tried with credit card) 
- Click "Add Payment Method" 
- Type in the same details you typed for the debit card that's already accepted in the billings tab 
- At the end click "Save" 
- At the top a bubble in red appears saying "Opps! You've caught an ultra rare error. This is probably our fault, so please try again or check our status page."

####Expected result:
They should say that you already added this "card" and its not their fault for the "Ultra rare error" to happen
####Actual result:
A bubble in red will appear saying there is a ultra rare error and its discord's fault
