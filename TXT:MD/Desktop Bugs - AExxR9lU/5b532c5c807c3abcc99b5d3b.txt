####Steps to reproduce:
- Go into a channel that has links to images or website previews posted in 
- Go into your User Settings -> Text & Images and enable or disable the embed preferences (easiest just to do both) 
- Exit out of your User Settings and observe that the embeds are still visible/gone

####Expected result:
The effect of the embed preference applies correctly when changed
####Actual result:
The effect isn't applies unless you scroll over the message with the url or switch to another channel and back
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.211, Build 19429
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home 64-bit (v1709)
