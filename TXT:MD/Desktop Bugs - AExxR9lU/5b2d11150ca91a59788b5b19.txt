####Steps to reproduce:
- Scroll completly down 
- type some text 
- make Line-break (with shift+enter) 
- see it scroll up automatically 
- scroll manually down 
- make a new break 
- loop

####Expected result:
You can always see the complete text of the chat
####Actual result:
Scrolls up with every linebreak so you cant see the chat anymore. (Admins told me, to resubmit with the note: its stable only)
