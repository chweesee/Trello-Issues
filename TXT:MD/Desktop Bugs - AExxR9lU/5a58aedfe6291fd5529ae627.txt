Reported by Brandon#6038

####Steps to reproduce:
- Upload mostly transparent animated emote to server (not all work, for example, try <> 
- Send emote in chat. 
- Notice difference between uploaded emote and emote on Discord.

####Expected result:
Emote will be exactly the same with no frame overlap.
####Actual result:
Each frame overlaps over the top of one another and gives an incredibly weird and undesired effect.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary (build 9510)
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home (64-bit)
