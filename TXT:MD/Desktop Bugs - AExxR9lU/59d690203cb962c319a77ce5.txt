Reported by Greebo#0397

####Steps to reproduce:
- Click search 
- Type a character that has an accented form by holding the key down and selecting the accent you want.

####Expected result:
It type the character, removes the original character and places your position in the text at the end. (e.g. if character Ã¤ for it to be like Ã¤Â¦ [with the Â¦ being  position in text])
####Actual result:
The position in the text is behind the accented character with the original character being there. (e.g. aÂ¦Ã¤)
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.155
####System settings:
MacBook OSX 10.12.6
