Reported by Blastoise186#7194

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a new Server 
- Access a Text Channel 
- Send any message that includes the Someone Mention

####Expected result:
There should be no trace of a Mention because the Someone Mention has been Disabled and there is no User called Someone
####Actual result:
The Someone Mention appears as if it is a valid Mention, but does NOT Mention anyone or show the Rainbow
