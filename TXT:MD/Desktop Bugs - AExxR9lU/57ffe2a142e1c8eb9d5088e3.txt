Short Description:
Server Mention Bubble (tells you unread amount of mentions) that were sent in a channel you were removed from (ex. permission-only channels) remain.
Steps to reproduce

1) Have a buddy give you a permission which adds you to a channel.
2) Have them mention you in said channel.
3) Have your buddy remove the permission after a few seconds (when your phone reports you of the mention).
4) Now check that server on your android phone, the red unread mention bubble is there but no text channel is viewable to remove it

Expected Result
No unread red mention bubble at the server's icon, just like on Desktop.

Actual Result
There's an unread red mention bubble at the server's icon from the 'hidden'/ghost text channel which can't be removed unless you use your desktop version (as the channel you were originally mentioned in can't be 'read').

### This is a backend issue as it also happens on desktop.  You can reproduce it by deleting the message.

I CANNOT reproduce this by deleting the channel.  This is being moved to general/canary bugs. - Jared on 2016-10-24T20:11:23.001Z
