####Steps to reproduce: 
- Right-click a "pinned a message to this channel" alert and add a reaction to it 
- Check the pin alert on an Android device (possible iOS) 
- There are reactions showing up. 

####Expected result:
 No "add reactions" right-click option on alert pins, Andy mentioned this should be fixed on the desktop-level. 
####Actual result:
 Right-click "add reactions" option on alert pins 
####System settings:
 Windows 10 Ultimate x64, latest Desktop Canary as of writing

### To be perfectly clear: we should decide our stance on reactions to system messages. If they can be added, they should be displayed, if they shouldn't be displayed, they shouldn't be able to be added.

Right now Desktop can add them but doesn't display them, Android can't add them but does display them. - Andy Garron on 2017-04-21T17:30:29.897Z

### right now you can add a reraction to a system message useing the \`+:emoji:\` syntax on desktop.
