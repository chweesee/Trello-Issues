####Steps to reproduce:
- scroll down in your recent DMs and choose someone at the bottom of the list (don't message them or anything) 
- Open up a server 
- have someone DM you 
- Open the DM notification 
- the recent DMs list stays at the previous position instead of jumping to the top like it does on mobile.

####Expected result:
Recent DMs list jumps back up to the top to the current conversation.
####Actual result:
Recent DMs stays at the previous position.
