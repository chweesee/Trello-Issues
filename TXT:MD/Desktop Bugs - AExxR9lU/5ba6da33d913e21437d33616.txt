### Can reproduce. The issue is that the title bar is not transparent any more, so it's cutting off part of the video. - Jared on 2018-09-25T21:00:07.629Z


### Can't reproduce.
Titlebar has gone back to being transparent a few builds after this bug was approved, but since this ticket is still in Verified Bugs, I am putting a cnr on it. Windows 10 Pro x64, Release Channel: Canary 27494
