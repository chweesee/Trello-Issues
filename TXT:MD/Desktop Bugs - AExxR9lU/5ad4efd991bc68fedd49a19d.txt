####Steps to reproduce:
- Set Discord's language to Greek 
- Click the cog next to a voice channel to access the channel's settings 
- While in the Overview tab hover the cursor over the User limit scroll bar while it is on the far left (unlimited users)

####Expected result:
The string No limit translated (ŒöŒ±ŒΩŒ≠ŒΩŒ± ŒåœÅŒπŒø) should be "inside" the tooltip
####Actual result:
The text is outside of the tooltip and behind the scrollbar. Also trying to change the limit will crash Discord
####Client settings:
Canary 13630
####System settings:
Win10 x64

### I suspected this was a Crowdin bug, since I checked Crowdin for this particular string and the approved string had syntax errors.

I approved an another which doesn't have syntax errors. So hopefully it will fix the issue,

### Cannot reproduce anymore, Discord Canary 0.0.210 (16727) on Windows 01 Pro 64-bit (1803). And I was correct, it was a string issue causing the crash. Now it's just overflowing. But it's unsupported per charter. So I am moving this to claimed fixed. - Tarek on 2018-06-11T17:29:26.613Z
