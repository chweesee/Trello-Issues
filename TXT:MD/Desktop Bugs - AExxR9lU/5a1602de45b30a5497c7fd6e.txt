### This bug was checked during the Trello Cleanup event, and is no longer reproducible. What it does now is that it makes your account to become unclaimed (at least look like it.) The ticket has already been made here: https://trello.com/c/makkJGQL/1698-changing-the-language-of-discord-on-another-device-causes-it-the-desktop-app-to-think-that-the-account-is-unclaimed

Used Windows 10 Home x64 (1803) and Windows 10 Pro x64 with Discord Canary Build 18197. Because I am no longer able to reproduce this bug, I'm moving it to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-06T00:29:41.090Z
