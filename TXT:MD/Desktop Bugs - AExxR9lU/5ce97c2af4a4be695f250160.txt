####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure your client is not maximized. 
- Resize it to 1600x900 if possible. The width of the window matters more. As long as your window dimensions isn't conventional 4:3 / 16:9 / anything along those lines, it's easy to reproduce. 
- Observe any profile with a HypeSquad House badge, preferably Brilliance because it's round.

####Expected result:
Badge is fully visible.
####Actual result:
Badge is cut off on left and/or bottom.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 38556
####System settings:
Windows 10 x64 (1803)
