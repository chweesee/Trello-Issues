Reported by Kuuhaku#4503

####Steps to reproduce:
- Right click to open the context menu but do not release it 
- Put your cursor to one of the options available in the context menu 
- Release the right click button

####Expected result:
On releasing the right-click, it should be treated as a second click as it does with the OS and other programs
####Actual result:
Nothing happens and you have to left click on it for the click to be actually registered
####Client settings:
Canary Build 10382
####System settings:
macOS 10.12.6
