Reported by charleskimbac#6492

####Steps to reproduce:
- open up a game(make sure discord gives you the playing status) 
- go live 
- go to a group dm 
- ask the other people(who are not in the server where you're streaming) to see if it says you're playing a game under your username 
- tell them to open your profile and see that you have a playing status there though

####Expected result:
you have a playing status under your name in the member list since you have one in your profile
####Actual result:
no status shows
####Client settings:
canary 44851
####System settings:
windows 10 home
