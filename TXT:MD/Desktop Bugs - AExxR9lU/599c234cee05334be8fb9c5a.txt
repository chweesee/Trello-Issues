### Can reproduce.
Can reproduce by using one of the search commands and posting  random letters/numbers so that no results show up (or just attempt with the gamerescape command if it isn't still non-functional as you're reading this), then highlight all the text in the field and deleting it | Discord Canary 0.0.204, Build 12458, Windows 10 Home 64-bit (v1709)
