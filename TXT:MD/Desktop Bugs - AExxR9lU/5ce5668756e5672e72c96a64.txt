Reported by JohnyTheCarrot#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Through a bot account, fire an API request to lock an emote behind a role (only possible on bot accounts). (Ask me in Bug Chat for the docs.) 
- Give yourself the role 
- Notice you can see the emote in your emote list since you have the needed role 
- remove the role from yourself 
- notice the emote has disappeared, good. 
- add the role back to yourself 
- notice the emote has not reappeared in your client and there will be no way to use the emote until client restart.

####Expected result:
When adding the role back, the emote should reappear and be usable again.
####Actual result:
The emote stays gone as if the role was never added back.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 38248
####System settings:
