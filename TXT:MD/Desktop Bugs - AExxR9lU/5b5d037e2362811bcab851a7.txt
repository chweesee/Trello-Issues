####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Discord on Firefox 
- You have two options: 
- 1st option: Create a webhook and observe how the webhook url is truncated 
- 2nd option: Go to Server settings -> Widget, and observe how the premade widget is truncated

####Expected result:
The dots should be right next to the text
####Actual result:
They are oddly far away
####Client settings:
Canary 20174
####System settings:
macOS Sierra 10.12.6, Firefox Quantum 61.0.1 (64-bit)
