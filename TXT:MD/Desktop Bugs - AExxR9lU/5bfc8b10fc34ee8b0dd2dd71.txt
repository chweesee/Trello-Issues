Reported by SuperSajuuk#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a server where you have admin/ability to manage roles. 
- Go to the Permissions tab on a channel or category. 
- Now go to another server where you have the same access and repeat. 
- Observe the list of roles in the channel permissions.

####Expected result:
You would see the list of roles and permissions for the server you're viewing.
####Actual result:
The first server you load follows you all over Discord, so you can no longer effectively edit your channel/category permissions.
####Client settings:
Canary 0.0.224 (Build 28421)
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro (64-bit), Creators Update (v1709, Build 16299.547)
