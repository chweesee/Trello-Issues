### Quoting Night:

"Inline false means it will get its own line. A 2x2 is not possible. We have a max length that makes it such that you would end up with 3 on a line, it just doesn’‘t work like that and wont ever probably.
The purpose of inline is solely for placing something on its own line." - Jared on 2017-01-05T19:05:03.953Z
