### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Pro x64 Canary Build 27465 mouse 3 takes me backwards and mouse 4 takes me forwards this is on the standalone client and it does not exhibit this behavior on stable, I suspect it's because of the electron 4.x we had recently

### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Home. Canary 27465. I believe discord should make a controls tab in settings, so you can have different buttons for different actions.
