Reported by SuperSajuuk#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a server. 
- Post a link to a marketing page in chat.

####Expected result:
The link preview to a marketing page woud load normally.
####Actual result:
A 404 page loads first for all marketing pages before the actual page is loaded, which results in no embeds being generated by posting links to them in chat.
####Client settings:
Canary 0.0.224 (Build 28567)
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro (64-bit), Creators Update (v1709, Build 16299.547)
