####Steps to reproduce:
- Have desktop open, and browse normally while you wait on a role ping. 
- Have someone to ping the role (could be the Mod role, or the iOS TestFlight role when there is iOS announcements for example). 
- Open the channel where you see the mention, view it. That should mark it as read. But you have to do it quickly for best results. 
- Leave the desktop client alone and wait for the AFK period to come in.

####Expected result:
You should not get any notification of the role ping on mobile, even though you have already read it.
####Actual result:
As soon that the desktop client goes AFK, you get the notification of the said role notification on mobile even though you have already read the said mention.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary Build 39549 and iOS TestFlight Build 3.0.3 (15702)
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64 (1809) and iOS 12.4 Dev Beta 3 on iPhone XS Max.
