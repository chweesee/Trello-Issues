####Steps to reproduce:
- Open up server settings 
- Click "Roles" 
- Create a new role 
- Name it 
- Press Enter 
- Click "Save Changes" 
- While the changes are being saved, click the plus icon that creates a new role

####Expected result:
The client should just not save the role that it was attempting to save
####Actual result:
The discord client crashes and says "Well, this is awkward. Looks like Discord has crashed unexpectedly..."
