####Steps to reproduce:1) Make sure you have Spotify and it's integrated to your Discord account. 2) Get into a VC and start playing a song on Spotify. 3) Press on your own profile picture thing to see the activity. 4) Press and play the song a few times (USE YOUR DEDICATED MEDIA KEYS, NOT IN THE TASK BAR) 5) Move around in the different VC channels and press on the profile again and try again, there will be a video on me doing it showing you that it works.

####Expected result:
Spotify Rich Presence is supposed to be stopped when you stop the song on Spotify.
####Actual result:
Spotify Rich Presence keeps on going on when the Spotify client clearly says that the song is stopped.
