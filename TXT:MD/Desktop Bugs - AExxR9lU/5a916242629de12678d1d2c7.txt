Win7 SP1 x64, 1680x1050 resolution, Guild Wars 2. Bug present both in current Stable and Canary releases. Through multiple reinstalls and reboots I only managed to make the overlay appear *once*, and never again.

### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Home 1920x1080 resolutions. No games at all work for me despite reboots and both versions of Canary and regular Discord. Some games include Rocket League, Minecraft, Osu, Of Guards And Thieves(which I have seen work with others) and Paladins.

### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Pro build 17120.1. My overlay doesn't work in any game (including Overwatch) if the computer resolution is more than 1920*1080p. It will work for 1080p, but after (2K, etc...), do not count on it. I have logs saved.

### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Pro Version: 1709  Build: 16299.248 1920x1080 resolution.  Windows Display Scaling and layout: 125%.  Overwatch, Warframe, Borderlands 2, Earthfall.  Work around: changing Windows Display Scaling and layout=100% will show the Discord UI.  Looks like a scaling issue!
