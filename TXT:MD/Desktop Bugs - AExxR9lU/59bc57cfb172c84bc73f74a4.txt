### After the update it does jump, but you can't jump to the same pin twice in a row, so you have to jump to a random one to unlock the one you really want to go back to

### Can reproduce.
Can jump to a pin only once, when done it can't be reached again without restart. Windows 10 Pro (64-bit), Anniversary Update (Build 1607), Canary 0.0.163 (Build 4358)
