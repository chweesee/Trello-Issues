### It seems that it doesn't detect any program if it's been opened after Discord. Same thing happened to me with Steam earlier.

### Can reproduce.
Seems to be a general issue, happening with TES Skyrim. In-game Overlay is also broken.

### This is a more general issue where some things are being detected and some aren't. Overwatch works for me, but Minecraft doesn't work at all.  Chris is currently investigating.  I'm changing the title of this bug from `Overwatch won't show as a status` to a more appropriate title. - Jared on 2017-02-15T20:24:04.074Z
