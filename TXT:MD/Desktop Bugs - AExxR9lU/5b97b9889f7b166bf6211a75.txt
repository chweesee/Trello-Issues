Reported by Matthew#9001

####Steps to reproduce:Go to "Home" 
- Look at your dm list to the left 
- Place your cursor to the very left outside the highlighted box of a friend's username 
- Observe the cursor icon 
- It should be a hand, not the default/pointer 
- Right click 
- Menu should open 
- Left click 
- Nothing should happen 
- Do the same for any server's text channel 
- Both left and right click should work just outside the highlighted box 
- Do the same to the very right of the friend highlighted box 
- Neither work and cursor doesn't change 
- Either both clicks should work or neither 
- This bug applies to all desktop builds/browsers + OS

####Expected result:
Either both clicks or neither clicks should work to the left of the friend box.
####Actual result:
Only right click works; left click does not to the left of the highlighted box.
