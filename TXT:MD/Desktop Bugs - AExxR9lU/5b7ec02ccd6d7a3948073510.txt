Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Be in a channel where you have Embed Links permissions, and where explicit content filter is enabled  
- In the same message, post several links that produce an embed each, with ONE link that's gonna be detected as explicit 
- Send the message in chat

####Expected result:
Only the embed detected as explicit shouldn't show up
####Actual result:
ALL embeds will break, even those that aren't explicit
####Client settings:
N/A (cross-platform). Personally tested on Discord Alpha 7.4.0 (Android client)
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0

### This is not a bug. The embed permission is done per message, not per link. - Jared on 2018-08-23T18:44:53.866Z
