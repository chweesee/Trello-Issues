Reported by Jo#5934

####Steps to reproduce:
- 2 people need to be vcing in the group chat already 
- without joining the vc you have to right click on other people from the group chat 
- then you click ring

####Expected result:
you should have to be in the vc to ring people as it can cause confusion and can be abused to spam ring others
####Actual result:
it lets you spam ring people without being in a call and no one will know it is you
