Reported by tri'ngle#9036

####Steps to reproduce:
- Click in search bar to open options window 
- Receive a desktop notification 
- Click through to the chat it's from

####Expected result:
Search options window goes away because the bar becomes unfocused
####Actual result:
Search options window remains. It can only be dismissed by clicking in and out of the search bar, clicking outside makes it reappear after a while.
####Client settings:
Canary 0.0.154
####System settings:
Mac OS X 10.12.6
