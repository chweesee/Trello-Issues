####Steps to reproduce:
- have Discord Desktop set to German and have a German keyboard 
- go anywhere where you can set hotkeys, e.g. settings>hotkeys or >overlay->hotkeys 
- click on edit/add hotkey where it then goes into key input recording mode 
- input one of the certain keys that differ between German QWERTZ and English QWERTY keyboards, e.g "Ã„" or "#"

####Expected result:
The preview for the hotkey should show exactly the keys you pressed.
####Actual result:
Incorrect, supposedly English position-wise equivalent keys are shown even when the "correct" hotkeys are registered.
####Client settings:
