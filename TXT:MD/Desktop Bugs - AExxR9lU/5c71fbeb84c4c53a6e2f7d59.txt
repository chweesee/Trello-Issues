Reported by Lelantos#4866

####Steps to reproduce:
- The server must have over 100+ members online in order to trigger the @​here warning when you attempt to ping the member. (You can ping the member if there are not more than 100 people online.) 
- Make an alternative account with "here" at the beginning of the name. (E.g mine was called "hereforthemoney") 
- Join the server with both your main account & alternative account & 100+ members. 
- Use your main account to attempt to ping hereforthemoney. It prompts you with the @​here warning verifying you wanting to ping 100+ people who are online.

####Expected result:
You should've pinged @here.
####Actual result:
The user gets pinged despite the warning prompt saying you'll ping @here.
