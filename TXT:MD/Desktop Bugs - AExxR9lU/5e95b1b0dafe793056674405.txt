####Steps to reproduce:
- ```
:emote:` :emote:*`
```

- 'Preview emotes, mentions and markdown syntax as you type' (wysiwyg) needs to be enabled

- Any characters can replace *, as long as they don't change the rendering.

- Before the first :emote, there needs to be at least a number of characters equal to the length of the second :emote: plus colons (:emote: would need at least 7 characters to break).

- The first :emote: can be any emote, even standard ones.

- The second :emote: needs to be a custom emote from a server you're in; Nitro is not required

####Expected result:
The chatbox should render the first emote, not the second and any surrounding text
####Actual result:
Discord stops responding completely and needs to be restarted
####Client settings:

####System settings:
