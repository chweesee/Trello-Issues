####Steps to reproduce:
- Be in at least two servers: one that you own (and are alone in, no other members are in the server) and one that you do not own and has other people in it 
- Toggle between the two servers

####Expected result:
The "Invite Friends" and Quick Switcher tip toggle immediately upon switching between servers
####Actual result:
There is a delay between the two tips switching (on browser it's about 1 second, on client app it's more like 5 seconds)
####Client settings:
Stable 35773
####System settings:
MacBook Pro, Version 10.13.6
