Reported by Pascal#0929

####Steps to reproduce:
- Use any system language that doesn't use a `,` as a thousands separator (e.g. German, also works with others) 
- Open the search 
- Search for anything that has more than 1000 results 
- Observe the search result count and look for the thousands separator

####Expected result:
You should see the correct thousands separator based on your system language.
####Actual result:
For many languages the wrong thousands separator is shown (most of the time `,` instead `.` or a space).
####Client settings:
Canary Build 24227
####System settings:
MacBook Pro 13" (2016), macOS High Sierra 10.13.6
