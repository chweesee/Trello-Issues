Reported by DJScias#0812

####Steps to reproduce:
- Start screensharing with someone (desktop or window-only, doesn't matter) 
- Go to another DM and scroll up for a bit (until it starts loading previous messages) 
- Notice how the call breaks and screensharing tries to reload but honestly can't unless you restart the call

####Expected result:
Nothing, screensharing should continue as normal
####Actual result:
Screensharing and call starts to disconnect, has trouble re-establishing screenshar.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary Build 15434
####System settings:
