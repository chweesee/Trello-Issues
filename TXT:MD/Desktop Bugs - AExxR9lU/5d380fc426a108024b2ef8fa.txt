Reported by Haru ðŸ’™ðŸŒ¸#6660

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a folder with muted servers in it and no unreads 
- Get pinged in a muted server 
- Right click the folder and try to mark as read

####Expected result:
You can mark the folder as read to get rid of the pings similar to how you can do it on a muted server
####Actual result:
You can't mark the folder as unread
####Client settings:
