####Steps to reproduce:
- Use a key on your numpad (num 3). 
- Press down on the PTT key. 
- Hold down shift. 
- Let go of PTT key while still holding shift.

####Expected result:
My PTT should "deactivate" (I should stop being "keyed up"/speaking).
####Actual result:
I continue to stay "keyed up" and people can still hear me speaking.
