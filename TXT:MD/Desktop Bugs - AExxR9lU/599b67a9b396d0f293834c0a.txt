### unfortunately I cannot reproduce this on Win10 x64 in Discord 0.0.301 or Canary 0.0.214 [c170.png](https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/5771673855f47b547f2decc3/599b67a9b396d0f293834c0a/380fd72db526cf624eb9d4d31ad42676/c170.png) 

Didn't even install any drivers, just plugged it in and it worked.

Can I get some more information about other webcam software that might be installed? - Ben Morse on 2018-10-05T17:34:51.056Z


### I can no longer repro as well + the user who reported the issue left the server =/ - Clayton on 2018-10-19T02:15:09.060Z
