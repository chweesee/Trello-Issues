Reported by Hindsight#2020

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have 2 users with identical discrims and username except one letter's case (ˋLink#​0001ˋ and ˋlink#​0001ˋ) 
- Attempt to mention the user with all lowercase

####Expected result:
Pings the user you were trying to ping
####Actual result:
Pings the user with the uppercase letter in username (I'm sure there's other variations on this)
