Reported by cutelilberry#5423

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to User Settings>Games 
- Hover over the added games (as shown in the Video)

####Expected result:
I'd assume that the icon should appear when the game is not compatible with the overlay but shouldn't appear if it works fine
####Actual result:
The icon appears for a split second then disappears
####Client settings:
Discord stable 0.0.300 9672
