####Steps to reproduce:
- Ensure that you have friends on any platform that you are connecting to who isn't your friend on Discord, like LoL and the application is running. 
- Go to Users Settings 
- Go to Connections 
- Click on the said application / platform's icon, like LoL's. 
- You do not need to connect, but close it after doing on so. 
- Observe.

####Expected result:
You should see the connection section without any error messages, even though it is working.
####Actual result:
You get an error message, saying that either the application isn't running or there was no new account, even though the feature is working correctly.
