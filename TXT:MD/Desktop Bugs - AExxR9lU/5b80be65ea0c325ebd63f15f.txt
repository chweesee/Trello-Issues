Reported by Rashaun#9295

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to the "What's New" section of the activity tab on 100 zoom and observe the size of the game sections (they should be in two columns in 100 zoom) 
- Change your zoom level to 125 zoom without leaving the activity tab and then observe the game sections again 
- Without changing zoom level, tab into a random server and back into the activity tab 
- Scroll down to the "What's New" section and observe the game sections (they should be in one column) 
- Change your zoom level to 100 without leaving the activity tab and observe the game sections again

####Expected result:
Game sections should change width when zoom level is changed
####Actual result:
Games sections change width after you tab out of and back into the activity tab
