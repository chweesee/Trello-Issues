####Steps to reproduce:
- Set Discord's zoom to 67% (setting chat font scaling to 80% may help with repros) 
- Have a friend play a game that can appear in the Games tab (reproduced with Undertale and osu!, can only be reproduced with some game icons) 
- Open Games tab 
- observe

####Expected result:
There should be one game icon next to the game's name in the Games tab.
####Actual result:
The game icon appears; however, there is a sliver of a duplicate game icon under the original icon.
####Client settings:
Stable build #24972
####System settings:
MacOS Mojave 10.14, 13-inch MacBook Air 2017
