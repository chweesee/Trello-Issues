Reported by Tarek#1337

####Steps to reproduce:
- Send a normal message 
- Then edit the message and mention something via <@ > or <# > and so on 
- Observe how it automatically resolves

####Expected result:
It shouldn't resolve the mention until you have successfully edited message, rather than doing it in the edit modal
####Actual result:
It resolves the mention in the edit box
