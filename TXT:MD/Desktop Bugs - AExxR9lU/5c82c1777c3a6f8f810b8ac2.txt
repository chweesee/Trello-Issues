Reported by KazWolfe#2896

####Steps to reproduce:
- Navigate to a verified guild with a banner without channel scrollbar (you may need to collapse categories if you can't find one) 
- Open Inspector or change window size so the scrollbar appears 
- Scroll down enough to hide banner 
- Switch to a guild without banner 
- Resize the window back to full, or close Inspector 
- Switch back to original bannered guild

####Expected result:
The banner should appear again instead of disappearing and leaving a blank space
####Actual result:
The banner is invisibile and the guild acts as though there is no banner, but a space is present.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 33599, 80% zoom on screen
####System settings:
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Gnome 3.28.2 - Screen size 3840x2160
