####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to pins 
- Attempt to click anywhere on the message to jump 
- Observe it not jumping unless you click on "Jump" like on stable

####Expected result:
It's supposed to jump even if you don't directly click on jump like how it is on stable
####Actual result:
It does not jump to the message unless you click on the button itself
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.211 (19091)
