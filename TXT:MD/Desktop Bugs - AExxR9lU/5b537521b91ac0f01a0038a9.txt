####Steps to reproduce:
- (If you have discord open) close discord 
- Open discord again 
- Look at the discord icon

####Expected result:
If you have the notification badge enabled usually, you should see it when starting discord
####Actual result:
The badge is not there and you have to disable and enable it in settings (however, sometimes it randomly stops working and you can't disable/enable for it to show up)  -
####Client settings:
Canary 19429
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64 (Build 17134.165)
