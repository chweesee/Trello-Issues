####Steps to reproduce:
- Go into settings to check Changelog 
- Once clicked on Changelog it seemed as if the windows expanded for a second, but nothing else happens. 
- Exit out of settings and Changelog shows, top of background goes out of sync, and Discord becomes slow for a couple seconds.

####Expected result:
Changelog should open when you click on it.
####Actual result:
The window moves slightly and have to exit settings to see Changelog and Discord bugs out for a couple seconds
####Client settings:
