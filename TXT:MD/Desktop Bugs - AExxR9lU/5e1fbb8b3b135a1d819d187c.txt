### You need to have not disabled the functionality in the first place at system preferences -> dock -> double-click a window's title bar to <option>. Any of those options still work (the other is minimise). I can still reproduce on  canary 52710 same device/macOS version as a below cr stated that it was fixed, but not for me.
