Reported by Ene#0808

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Search in a channel 
- Begin typing enough to force Search to expand out of view and observe how the field doesn't move with you

####Expected result:
Text field moves as you continue to type and expand the Search's text field so that you can see what you're typing
####Actual result:
Text field stays in view of only the beginning of the Search's text field, forcing you to manually highlight your text to get to your current position
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.211, Build 17486
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home 64-bit (v1709)
