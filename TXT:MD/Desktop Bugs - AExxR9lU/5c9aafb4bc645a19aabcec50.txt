Reported by TheForbiddenAi#7549

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open a game info tab with someone showing in the recent activity area 
- Right click on them 
- Untick the show on activity tab option 
- Attempt to tick the show on activity tab option 
- Observe how instead of the option enabling the game info menu just closes and leaves the show on activity tab button unticked 
- NOTE: To avoid confusion, the show on activity tab button only ticks after the second attempt I made at enabling it

####Expected result:
The show on activity tab button should enable first attempt
####Actual result:
The show on activity tab button does not enable first attempt
####Client settings:
