####Steps to reproduce:
- Step 1 
- Create a group (3+ people) Step 2 
- Send a message and notice the messed up right side bar that houses the members.

####Expected result:
Normal formatting in the members bar, just like how it should be in servers and group chats.
####Actual result:
The formatting should have the text not centered, with a somewhat weird font and styling compared to normal discord.
####Client settings:
Messages are set to cozy. Build 12477
####System settings:
Windows 10 x64
