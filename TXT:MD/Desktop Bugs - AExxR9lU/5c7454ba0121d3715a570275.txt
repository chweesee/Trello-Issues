Reported by TheForbiddenAi#7549

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go into server settings 
- Go into emojis 
- Add an emoji (skip this step if you already have one to test with) 
- Name anything you want as long as you put a space after it 
- Observe how the colon goes onto a new line

####Expected result:
You shouldn't be able to put spaces (This is because after you switch tabs the space gets replaced with an underscore)
####Actual result:
The colon goes onto a new line
####Client settings:
Canary 32759
####System settings:
