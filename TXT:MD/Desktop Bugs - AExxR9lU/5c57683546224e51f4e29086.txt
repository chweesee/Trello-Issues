####Steps to reproduce:
- Open your browser, and if you're logged in, log out. 
- Open the desktop client 
- Open the Games and then open Game Directory

####Expected result:
When you open the Game Directory, the browser goes to the game directory and nothing else happens.
####Actual result:
When you open the Game Directory, the client opens the store even though you did nothing that should trigger the store to open.
####Client settings:

### This works best on Chrome as other browsers such as Firefox cannot connect to the Discord client. The fact Firefox/other browsers cannot connect to the client is known: https://trello.com/c/9NOsdPEM
