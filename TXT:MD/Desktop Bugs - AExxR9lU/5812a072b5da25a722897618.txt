### Weeajew#3674:

Only way Weeajew is able to repro is in the Discord Testers server using BTTV emotes, can't repro anywhere else - Sam on 2016-11-03T13:21:27.055Z


### I can Repro this, Only can test BTTV but 津島 善子 ★★★★#9667 (which I swear was in the original report of this bug?) recreation is correct. - Cole Norman on 2016-11-03T22:06:03.811Z
