####Steps to reproduce:
- Have the owner or yourself (if you are the owner) make the two roles. One for the owner, one for the member. 
- Make sure the owner gives themselves the role without admin and the member gets admin and hoist. 
- Observe the Member List when it is done.

Your crown should disappear instantly
####Actual result:
Your crown does not disappears, you need to refresh your client before you can see your crown being gone.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary Build 15120
####System settings:

### If you do it to remove the Admin setting, the crown will not show up until you restart your client.
