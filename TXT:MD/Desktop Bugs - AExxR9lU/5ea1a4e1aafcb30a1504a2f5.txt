### Can reproduce.
Dell Precision 5520: Canary 59984 (f3380b6), Host 0.0.264, Windows 10 64-Bit (10.0.18363). This appears to be caused by the up/down keys not adjusting the curser column location in the line correctly when it reaches the bottom and is shifted to the end of the line by pressing down key. Repro by having curser at the beginning of the line and pressing down until reaching the end of the input, and then trying to shift+up select. Therefore, this can also be repro'd with shift+down as well, and can be done from any point in the line to result in a partial extra selection rather than just selecting an extra full line
