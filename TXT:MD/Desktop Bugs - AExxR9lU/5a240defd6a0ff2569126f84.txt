Reported by Garry#4825

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have the search results or member list open 
- Type something in the text box until you get a new line 
- Close the search results/member list -

####Expected result:
The text box gets wider and thinner, because the text fits into one line
####Actual result:
The text box gets wider and the text fits into one line, but the text box still has the same hight
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.183
####System settings:
Windows 10 Fall Creators Update
