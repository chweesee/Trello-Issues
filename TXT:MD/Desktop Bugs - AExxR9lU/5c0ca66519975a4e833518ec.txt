####Steps to reproduce:
- Have two devices with Discord open on the same account. (In my case, an iPhone, and MacBook Pro) 
- On one device, join a server with an invite that had temporary membership enabled. 
- Ensure that you won't be assigned roles. (For the temporary membership to work) 
- On the other device, quit your Discord client.

####Expected result:
I should stay in the server because I still have a session open on my phone.
####Actual result:
You get removed from the server even if you have another session active.
####Client settings:
Canary 29240 - TestFlight 2.4.0 (9714)
####System settings:
MacBook Pro (13", Mid-2012), macOS v10.14.1 (Mojave) - iPhone 6s, iOS 12.1.1 Beta (16C5050a)
