Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a GIF image (preferably with long duration so you can observe the bug more easily) 
- Make sure Autoplay GIFs is enabled 
- Post it 5-6 times in a channel. Make it so the first GIFs you posted go offscreen 
- Now scroll up slowly to show the gifs that are offscreen. While doing that, observe the GIFs at the bottom.

####Expected result:
When a new GIF gets in view, it shouldn't cause all the other GIFs that were already in view to restart
####Actual result:
All visible GIFs restart from first frame everytime a new GIF gets in view
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 22587
####System settings:
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Asus Netbook F551C, Intel Core i3 64bits
