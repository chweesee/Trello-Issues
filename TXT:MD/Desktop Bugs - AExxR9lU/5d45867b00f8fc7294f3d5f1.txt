####Steps to reproduce:
- Type a members name (@discord) 
- type a word after (@discordmuffin) 
- It will ping the guy named discord and still have the word muffin attached to the ping 
- A better example is if someone is named gmail, and you type your gmail in chat, it would have a ping half way through it.

####Expected result:
It should not ping since you kept typing text and you didnt type any numbers
####Actual result:
It pings the person and keeps the text
####Client settings:
Stable 42408
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro
