### Clicking on the user on the userlist closes the mini profile

### The bug can be reproduced by just clicking on the user then try to click the outside of mini profile other than the user itself. The miniprofile can also be removed by switching server.

### **The same thing is also happening with server dropdown**

### Alright, the bug is affecting all dropdowns in Discord except right click (server, pinned messages, mentions) and mini profile.
