####Steps to reproduce:
- Start playing a game 
- Open a program like OBS and start streaming 
- By now, you should have the purple status 
- Close the game 
- DO NOT close OBS 
- DO NOT manually exit streamer mode

####Expected result:
Since you are no longer playing the game and no longer streaming, the status should clear
####Actual result:
The status stays purple and links to your twitch as long as streamer mode is on
####Client settings:

####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro

### Not a bug..

I am not sure how this can be seen as a bug, considering OBS is still streaming the content (i.e a black screen because the game is closed down). The streaming presence (status) is not based of if you are actively streaming a game. If you are streaming content to Twitch, you'll still have a status. Even if you closed down your previous game.

Moving to not a bug. - Tarek on 2019-02-27T09:23:11.962Z
