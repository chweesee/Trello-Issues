####Steps to reproduce:
- Open any server and go to any text channel 
- Look at the message bar at the bottom of the screen where it says "Message #nameOfTextChannel" 
- Look at the flickering bar where it marks your cursor's location 
- Observe the rate at which it clickers

####Expected result:
The flashing/flickering, as I believe, is supposed to flash/flicker at an even, constant rate between intervals.
####Actual result:
The bar which marks your cursor's location flashes/flickers at uneven, random intervals which have significant changes.
