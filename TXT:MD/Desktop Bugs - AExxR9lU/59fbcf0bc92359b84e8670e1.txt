Reported by tomGER#7462

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have another system language (I used german) 
- Have the discord setting set to another language 
- Restart Canary / Update it

####Expected result:
You should still have the language you set manually as your discord language
####Actual result:
Discord tells you that you're still using another language (alias a language you manually set) while you're using your system language (here: german) and this can't be undone
####Client settings:
Desktop Canary
####System settings:
Win10 x64
