[Archived] Profile tab content not scaling, effect is greatest when the user is playing something. When content is empty, the Wumpus images won't scale and goes out of bounds. (https://trello.com/c/330DRknA)

Reported by JohnyTheCarrot#0368

####Steps to reproduce:
- Minimize Discord to it's minimum height 
- search for a user who's playing something (also works with someone who isn't playing anything but the effect is far smaller) 
- Try to scroll all the way to the bottom in user info. (you can't) 
- When the mutual servers/mutual friends tab is empty, the poor Wumpus doesn't fit in the box (modal) because he isn't scaled.

####Expected result:
You can scroll all the way down in the info tab, and when the mutual friends/servers tab is empty, the Wumpus fits in the modal.
####Actual result:
You can't scroll all the way down in the info tab, and the poor Wumpus is cut off.
