####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a role that you want/can delete with Administrator privelages 
- Click on Delete 
- Press Enter on the dialog

####Expected result:
The role is deleted.
####Actual result:
The dialog box closes and reopens, and for everytime you press enter, once you've stopped pressing enter and start clicking OKAY it doesn't work. E.g. 3x Enter = 6x dialog (3x enter causing another box + 3x clicking open another box) before it'll work.
