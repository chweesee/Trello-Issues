- Have that user have a rich presence (Fortnite, Spotify, Streaming, ect) 
- Open discord in browser 
- Open user profile and shrink window vertically until it resizes their profile 
- click on mutual servers/friends 
- scroll down

####Expected result:
Should be able to scroll and see all mutual servers/friends with the user
####Actual result:
Some of the mutual friends/servers get cut off at the bottom
