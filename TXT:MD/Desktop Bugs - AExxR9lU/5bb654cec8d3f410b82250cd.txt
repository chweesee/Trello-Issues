Reported by DoNotSpamPls#8787

####Steps to reproduce:
- Copy a Unicode 11 emoji from somewhere (e.g. Emojipedia) 
- Paste it somewhere in the Discord client (chat box, roles, nicknames, etc.)

####Expected result:
The emoji should render, albeit in its raw form (due to the old Twemoji version Discord uses)
####Actual result:
You just see a square
####Client settings:
Discord Canary, build 25439
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro, build 1809 (supports Unicode 11 emoji)
