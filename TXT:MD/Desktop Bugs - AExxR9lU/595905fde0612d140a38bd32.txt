Reported by Smexhy#6339

####Steps to reproduce:
- Clicking on the Discord Canary in the top left corner 
- Clicking on Services

####Expected result:
There should be list of available services
####Actual result:
After clicking on "services" nothing happens, so I can't see the list of available services. It is working just fine on other apps
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.149
####System settings:
macOS Sierra 10.12.5
