####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to Home 
- Go to Activity Tab 
- Focus your mouse somewhere to open a People List 
- Right click at a user from the People List 
- Hover your mouse to another game 
- Observe

####Expected result:
the first people list should close, because having 2 people list openning at the same time may cause overlaying
####Actual result:
the first people list does not close that has the context menu open from it, and may cause overlaying
