####Steps to reproduce:
- Make a friend 
- Start a Screenshare or video call with said friend 
- Start typing an emoji name in chat (ex :bl) which would trigger a list of blobs if you are in the blob server. 
- Notice the top of that picker is cut off. 
- Profit?

####Expected result:
You should be able to see the whole Emoji picker menu and not have it cut off at the top.
####Actual result:
The top of the menu is cut off <:blobsad:280621860822188032>
