### Appears to only be the case when window icon has red dot attached.

### I can also reproduce.
Using ShareX reveals that the icon is somehow of a bigger size in whatever way Windows grabs the icon.
Uploading two images, one showing the bug, and one showing "normal" behaviour from a different app.
