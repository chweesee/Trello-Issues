####Steps to reproduce:
- Choose 'channel' from left pane 
- Click on channel topic field 
- text: "this is a long channel topic, so long that you will want to not read it all, but you already started and now you feel obligated to finish it. The idea here is that you have to supply enough characters and instead of supplying lorem ipsum or any other random keyboard bashing, I want to be creatinve and supply you with a story about myself. Well, here is the story. I am here writing this long text, thinking about Avocade. Avocados are so tasty to me that I have to eat one completely" 
- click on options + R key

####Expected result:
The text should be trimmed after 1028 characters
####Actual result:
The counter goes below 0, users are able to save the channel details
####Client settings:
Release Channel: stable, Build Number: 29232
####System settings:
Mac 10.14.1
