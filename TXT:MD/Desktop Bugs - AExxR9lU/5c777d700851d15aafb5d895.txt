####Steps to reproduce:
- Must be on Microsoft Edge Discord Browser 
- We will use Discord client chat channel for a example, Click on Channel Topic 
- Once done it'll open a separate box for you to see all the words 
- Within that box there will be a small white outlined box on the bottom right corner appearing once you've opened the channel topic 
- If you didn't catch it in time, close out of the Channel Topic box and reopen it and you can see it appear for a short period of time

####Expected result:
Small outlined box isn't suppose to be there, it's acting like there's something to scroll
####Actual result:
When opening channel topic, there will be a small white box in the bottom right corner
####Client settings:
Discord Web Canary Stable 32960 Microsoft Edge v44.17763.1.0
####System settings:
