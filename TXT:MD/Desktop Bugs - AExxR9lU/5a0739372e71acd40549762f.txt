Low,
P3: Will get fixed eventually

Reported by [TRED] AlFas#2783

####Steps to reproduce:
- Send a message with strikethrough and at least one other formatting with a \` character on the strikethrough instead of \~ (\~\`\*example\*\~\~) 
- Edit the message and replace the \` character with the \~ character to produce normal strikethrough

####Expected result:
The message is edited properly and the client shows the edited message normally
####Actual result:
The edited message will appear twice, once without the strikethrough and the proper edited form right next to it (For the previous example: *example~~example~~*) - Note that the message itself is properly stored on the server and it is being displayed normally on other devices, this is a local client bug
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.173
####System settings:
Windows 10 x64
