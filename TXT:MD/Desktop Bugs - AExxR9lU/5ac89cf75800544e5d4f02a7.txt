####Steps to reproduce:
- Send a link linking to a webm video in a text channel 
- Send enough messages to have the option "JUMP TO PRESENT" in the lowest part of the screen when looking at the message containing the link 
- Play the video in full screen 
- Escape the video with the "escape" key

####Expected result:
The player should quit fullscreen without jumping to present
####Actual result:
The player quits fullscreen and jumps to present
####Client settings:
