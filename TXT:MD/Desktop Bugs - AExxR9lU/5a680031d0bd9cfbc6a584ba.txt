####Steps to reproduce:80% of the time, THIS HAPPENS ON RANDOM OCCASIONS. I understand this is in beta, that’s probably why there are errors such as these.  Step 1 
- Join a LFG group, it can be any group. Step 2 
- Leave that LFG group, there is a chance that the group will still be on your sidebar and if clicked will show an error page that says you “don’t have access to view this group”.  Step 3
- to remove this error, simply click the Leave Group icon until you fully leave the group, so that you may join another group.

####Expected result:
Just Leave the group and have the ability to join other groups at one’s leisure.
####Actual result:
Change’s status in group to a “Restricted viewing access error page”.
####Client settings:
Discord Web, Google Chrome (latest version)
####System settings:
Windows 10 x64 Home build 1511
