####Steps to reproduce:(specific to emotes with transparent elements) 
- upload animated emotes or look at a server where you have manage emote perms that has a large quantity of animated emotes 
- see animated emotes are corrupted seemingly at random 
- upload the same gif as an emote multiple times 
- send the original gif files of emotes (will also be corrupted) 
- opening gifs in browser to see uncorrupted gif 
- open the emote in browser to see the corrupted gif

####Expected result:
gifs sent/uploaded as emotes should display as they do in browser, animated emotes should remain the same over time
####Actual result:
gifs sent/uploaded as emotes are corrupted, emotes uploaded months ago are now corrupted files
####Client settings:
iOS 2.4.4 (11051), Desktop version 31744
####System settings:
iOS 12.1.2, Windows 7
