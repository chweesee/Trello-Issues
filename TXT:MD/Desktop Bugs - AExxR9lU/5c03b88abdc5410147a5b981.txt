### Can reproduce.
Can reproduce - Windows 10 x64 v1809, Discord Canary 28704 - ONLY seems to occur when there is not enough results for the results to become scrollable, if it does give you more results than it can display it once (thus allowing you to scroll through it) it doesn't mess it up as badly, tho clicking any of the categories will still make you go up to a random server (atleast in my case it was the 3rd server after 'Frequently Used', and the results afterwards will still be clickable just fine
