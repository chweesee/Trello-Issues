####Steps to reproduce:
- I make animated icon in Adobe After Effects, which is 2000x2000 pixels and 23fps. 
- Me and my friend boosts my server, so I can upload my animated icon. 
- I upload it, but, when I hit "save changes", it crashes my discord and automatically launches. 
- I see that my icon has not been changed.

####Expected result:
Discord server icon should change.
####Actual result:
Crashes discord and doesn't change server icon.
