### I spoke with Night about this and we both agreed it is a low priority, as this is an experiment currently.

For what its worth, Night said he has not fixed this in the past. - John Furrow on 2018-11-12T23:55:16.243Z


### @jfurrow I think Jared meant night fixed this for DMs. 

Since this used to happen in direct messages as well now it doesn't.  - Tarek on 2018-11-13T02:58:27.731Z


### @tarek1337 Ahh that makes sense, sorry for the misinterpretation. - John Furrow on 2018-11-13T21:14:39.840Z
