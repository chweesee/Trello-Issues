Reported by Nightmare Kitty#4567

####Steps to reproduce:
-Use a server, or create a new one.
-Create a channel, or use one.
-Go to Channel Settings, then turn on NSFW content.
-Supervise the server for a few hours to a few days (maybe switch between desktop and phone, but it's optional.)

####Expected result:
NSFW content is turned on for the channel, and stays that way unless settings are changed
####Actual result:
NSFW feature turns off automatically, there is nothing about it in the aduit log and I am the only admin. This happens after some extended period of time, as it is not a right away result.
####Client settings:
Discord Stable: 0.0.298, Discord Canary: 0.0.165
####System settings:
Dell Latitude E5540 (Intel Core i7 vPro) with Windows 10 Pro, x64 bit... Version 1703, OS Build 15063.674

### Upon further inspections, it is possible that it is happening in newer servers (that was fresh out of Wumpus' oven.) It can take a few hours to a few days, but it is possible that it is triggered after a constant use / switch of computer and phone.
