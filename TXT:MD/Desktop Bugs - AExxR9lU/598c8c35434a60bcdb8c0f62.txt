- set your nickname (or someone else's) to a long one that's under 33 chars, for example `TheLordofGaming/TheLordofHTMLhi`

The nickname should all fit on the screen, either by wrapping to multiple lines or by making the popup wider
####Actual result:
The ends of the name get cut off
####Client settings:
Canary 0.0.154
####System settings:
macOS Sierra 10.12.6 (16G29) (iMac Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2017)
