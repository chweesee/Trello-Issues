Reported by JohnyTheCarrot#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Make the window small enough so you can reach the three textbox buttons with a relatively small amount of SPACES (not anything else). (just for ease of reproduction)

- Type out a bunch of spaces, keep going until you can see the typing cursor go into the three buttons, this will delocate the three buttons and move the entire textbox to the left.

####Expected result:
The textbox adjusts so the typing cursor never goes over to the three buttons like how it is with normal characters.
####Actual result:
The typing cursor goes behind the three buttons and even delocates the textbox contents to the left.
