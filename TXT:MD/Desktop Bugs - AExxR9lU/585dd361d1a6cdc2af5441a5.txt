### Right clicking does not bring up the possibility to copy the url, only the standard context menu. If this is intended adding the ability to copy url would compliment this feature/bug.

### This is not a bug, nor is it intended. Discord is essentially a web browser and it's trying to open a link, because it's actually a link. 

This is not the place for feature request. Try feedback.discordapp.com - Jared on 2016-12-24T15:42:30.649Z
