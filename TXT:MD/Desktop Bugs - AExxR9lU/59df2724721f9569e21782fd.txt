### Can reproduce.
I've found that it took me several times, as it depends on the length of my messages. At first, I was not getting the results I was expecting to happen, but the next few times seemed to do it slightly. So, try it at least 5 to 10 times before you deny. | What it does for me is that my CPU spikes slightly from 6% to about 40% when performing the action, and when deleting the message.. Discord stops responding for a short but brief time but deletes the message after a delay. | Custom Built PC, Windows 10 Pro 64 Bit, Discord Stable Build:  5685

### I can't seem to be able to reproduce, I believe that this got fixed due to the recent change made to support animated emojis.
