### I could be wrong, but I'm 99% sure there is a bug already tht is similar. And BTW, white theme is pretty trash. Join the dark side.

### Checked as of latest canary:

I can no longer reproduce this myself. Checkbox works fine on light theme.

As per Dabbit's new "you can move stuff into claimed fixed" thingy, I'm movin' it. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-06-30T23:28:50.227Z
