### Can reproduce.
Can reproduce on Windows 10 Home x64 (Version 1803), Discord Canary Build 15598. You have to click on the profile picture to view the profile, but you will notice in the "Voice Connected" section that you get disconnected then reconnected again. Smells like a possible websocket issue.
