### I'm not convinced this is a bug, considering 502 is bad gateway, which is a server error.

Which means either MEDAL's & Streamable's servers were down at the time, or Discord's media proxy was. The reason why the DOMException happens is because of the client is trying to play something that is not playable.

Either way, I can't reproduce, Canary 36426 W10 1809.
