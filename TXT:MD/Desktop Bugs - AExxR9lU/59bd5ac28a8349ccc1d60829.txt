Reported by JohnyTheCarrot#0368

####Steps to reproduce:
- Search for a message in a channel 
- delete the channel on another device ***(the device used in the attachment is not a VM, but teamviewer for android)*** Press 'jump' on the message 
- See the loading channel load for ever 
- Go to a random server 
- Go back to the server where you deleted the channel.

####Expected result:
The search menu updates/closes when the channel where it's searching in is deleted, thus preventing the user from jumping to a message in a deleted channel.
####Actual result:
The menu does not update/close and I can still jump to the message.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.163, build 4358.
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home (Version 1703)
