Reported by Bryth#1086

####Steps to reproduce:
- Send a spotify track link 
- Click the Spotify icon/logo in the top right corner of the embed

####Expected result:
The track should play on your spotify app without anything happening on the discord client
####Actual result:
A page appears ("Opening Spotify..."), replacing the whole discord UI and prevents you from using it until you restart it (reloading it with CTRL + R doesn't work). I waited for about 30 minutes and the page didn't disappear
####Client settings:
Canary 62677 (f067d8f)
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64 1903 (18362.900)
