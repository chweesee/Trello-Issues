### Note: Must be in a voice channel with another user who is not muted. - Jared on 2017-01-27T23:01:11.973Z


### awesome repro - looking into it now. sadly, m56 does not fix this - Ben Morse on 2017-01-27T23:32:28.155Z


### when it breaks, the audio coming into the AudioInputPostProcessObserver is all zero amplitude (so VAD won't trigger, but even if it did, there's no audio to transmit) - Ben Morse on 2017-01-28T00:22:40.277Z
