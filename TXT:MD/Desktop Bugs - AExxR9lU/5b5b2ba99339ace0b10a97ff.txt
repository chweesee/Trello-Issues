### Can reproduce.
Can reproduce, Windows 10 Home Edition x64, Canary 20044. Better success rate if you don't have discord maximized (happens at the top of the screen).

### I should also mention that it doesn't flash at the top of discord for me, but instead the top of computer screen (I had another window maximized)
