Reported by Frances Picard#6209

####Steps to reproduce:
- Post many spoilers in one message as many as possible but not too few 
- (for example, put a character, spoiler that character, copy that spoiler tagged character, and paste it until you reached four lines of whole text input in fullscreen 1080p Discord desktop app, the other one takes five lines. See first attachment for paste amount estimation) 
- (You can put a message after spoilers to further repro) 
- Compare it to mobile version of Discord (Android/iOS)

####Expected result:
The message will not cut like when you see on mobile clients
####Actual result:
The message cuts, removing all remaining chats
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 31642
####System settings:
Windows 10 1809 x64

### Can reproduce.
Ubuntu 18.10, Desktop stable 31700 / Note: 198 "things" in a message is fine. The 199th thing and all text after will not show. "Thing" is known to include italics, bold, strikethrough, underscore, code blocks, emojis, links, mentions, and spoilers. "Thing" is known to not include regular text and would-be-things inside other things. It is possible that "thing" means any top-level element other than text.
