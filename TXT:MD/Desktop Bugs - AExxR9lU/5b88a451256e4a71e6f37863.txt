### Can reproduce.
On 90% zoom, the typing indicator gets cut off (and is misaligned), resulting in squares. Changing to 100% with ctrl + and then changing back results in the typing indicator scaling properly, but misaligning further. Switching channels will revert back to the square icon. | Windows 10 Pro x64, Release Channel: Canary 25661
