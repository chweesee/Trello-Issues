### Can reproduce.
It looks pretty awkward not being able to uncollapse muted channels without right click. Windows 10 Pro (64-bit), Anniversary Update (Build 1607), Canary 0.0.163 (Build 4053)

### Technically it's not lost, it just got moved to:

* Right click on the server icon
* Right click on some empty space in the channel list

It does make me wonder if it's worth putting in the server popout menu though to make it more accessible? It's kind of a power use feature now. - Amadeus on 2017-09-09T11:08:28.937Z


### this happens on android too
