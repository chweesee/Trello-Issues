### I talked to Stan and we're marking this as a Won't Fix. The problem is that when you mouse over a bunch of stuff you're making some animations happen (the three dots), and browsers kind of suck at animations, they eat up a ton of CPU. The only way we could fix this would be to remove that animation, which we're not going to do. - Jared on 2017-10-26T22:33:50.726Z
