Reported by SuperSajuuk#7265

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Post a picture in a channel (no specific requirements). 
- Click the picture. 

####Expected result:
 The preview loads instantly. 
####Actual result:
 There is a significant delay in the preview being loaded. 
####System settings:
 Latest Canary on W10 x64 Pro. NOTE: This has nothing to do with my internet connection. It's at 71mbps download speed, ~19mbps upload, and all previews are inherently sluggish everywhere.
