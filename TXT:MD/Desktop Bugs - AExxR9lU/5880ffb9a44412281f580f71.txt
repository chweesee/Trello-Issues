### Can reproduce.
Canary 18027 - Windows 10 Home x64 v1709 - Appears to be caused by the system message created when you pin the message, does not occur if the message is pinned by someone else.

### Can reproduce.
Desktop Stable 25070 - Windows 7 Ultimate x64 - Happens with call messages as well, which can not be deleted. Meaning a single call will render the uparrow useless for everything that happened before it.

### Only happens when the Pinned Message message is by you, implying that the client is considering that message as yours when it shouldn't.
