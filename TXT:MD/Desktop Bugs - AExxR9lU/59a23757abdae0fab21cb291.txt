####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to Server Settings on a server you own/are admin on/have the manage roles permission on 
- Go to the Roles tab 
- Scroll all the way down 
- Read the description for "Use Voice Activity"

####Expected result:
Since it's Server Settings, it would say "Members must use Push-to-talk in this channel if this permission is disallowed."
####Actual result:
it says "in this channel" instead of "in this server", as if it's in the channel settings
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.154 (Build 3661)
####System settings:
macOS Sierra 10.12.6 (16G29) (iMac Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2017)
