Reported by Marc#5983

####Steps to reproduce:
- go to a DM channel 
- at the top, where the user's name is, put your cursor over that 
- observe

####Expected result:
Should be the clicking cursor/pointing
####Actual result:
It's the one to highlight text (which you cant highlight the user's username in a dm channel unless you select their profile)
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 20433
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home (x64, 1803)
