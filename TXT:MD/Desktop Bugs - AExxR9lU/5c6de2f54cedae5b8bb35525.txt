Reported by J1#0088

####Steps to reproduce:
- have an alt and make it join the server you are going to test in 
- create a private channel that your alt cannot access 
- open that channel then logout without leaving it 
- log in with your alt account and observe that you main account's server flash for a brief second and instead of being taken to activity tab when logged in, you're in the same channel

####Expected result:
when first logged in, i should be taken to activity tab
####Actual result:
the servers from the first account flash for a moment then you're taken to the channel the first account was in
