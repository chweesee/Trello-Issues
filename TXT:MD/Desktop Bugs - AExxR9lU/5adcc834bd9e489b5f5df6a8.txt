Reported by figgyc#0168

####Steps to reproduce:
- Switch channel 
- Try to press home or end

####Expected result:
it goes to the top or bottom of the message panel
####Actual result:
if you switch channels with mouse then it scrolls the channel pane which is understandable, but after switching channels with keyboard it just does nothing until you click in the box
####Client settings:
Canary 13990
####System settings:
Windows 10 x64 1709
