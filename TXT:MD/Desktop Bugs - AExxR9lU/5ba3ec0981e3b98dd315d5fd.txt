####Steps to reproduce:
- Click upload image. 
- Drag the image you want from 'Open' into the discord client (to prompt upload). 
- Click cancel on the 'Open' window. 
- Click back on the main client and it stops responding.

####Expected result:
The client should not crash, and I should be able to upload the image normally.
####Actual result:
When you click on the client, instead of continuing with the upload the client crashes.
####Client settings:
