### Can't reproduce.
TTS isnt able to do it, since it will mess up words of the sentence and it has a limit, which is set Regarding on the symbols you use. It is not a bug

### TTS has never been intended to read an entire message, just a limited number of characters. See Jake's comment. - Jared on 2018-05-08T18:15:56.274Z
