Reported by Logiz#9321

####Steps to reproduce:
- Set your window width to roughly 1400 (+-) 
- Set zoom to 110, (possibly text size to 100) 
- Hold down a key (lowercase L seems to be the least "spammy") until the top border goes down a few pixels

####Expected result:
Text field border stays consistent.
####Actual result:
Top border decreases by a few pixels.
