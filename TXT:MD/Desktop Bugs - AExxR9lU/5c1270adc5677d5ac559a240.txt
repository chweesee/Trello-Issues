####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure the Discord client is running. It does not matter whether it is visible or idle or being interacted with. 
- Download procmon from and run it. 
- Disable all activity filters on procmon's toolbar except for Show Registry Activity. 
- Hold the `End` key and observe that a vast majority of the events zipping by are from , happen every second and are related to msvideo and/or Driver.

####Expected result:
I expected to only see the registry activity when Discord was visible and being interacted with
####Actual result:
Exactly as described in the description and repro steps
####Client settings:
"Release Channel: stable, Build Number: 29445, Version Hash: b7fbda1fde750c0db4d7e7e81dd4a573c89b3a7", also reproducible in a build at least 2 weeks old.
####System settings:
