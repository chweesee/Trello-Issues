####Expected result:
The Change Log modal should be contained within the viewport, such that the (X) is clickable and the "Missed an update? Check out our previous change logs" message is visible.
####Actual result:
The Change Log modal goes outside of the viewport, making both the (X) and previous change logs link unclickable.
