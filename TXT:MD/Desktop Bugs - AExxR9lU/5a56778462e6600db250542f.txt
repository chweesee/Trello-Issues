Reported by JohnyTheCarrot#0368

####Steps to reproduce:
- Upload an image which you haven't uploaded before since last PC restart. (so no cache) 
- Open it 
- See it transparent and also see the loading spinner for a couple of seconds and then it disappears, leaving you with nothing.

####Expected result:
Discord shows you the image is loading by keeping the transparent image and the loading spinner.
####Actual result:
Transparent image and spinner show up for a couple of seconds, after which they both disappear leaving you with only the "open original" button.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 9405
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home, Version 1709

### Cannot reproduce. The gifs are loading normally. - Jared on 2018-01-17T00:17:01.126Z

### Can reproduce.
This happens nearly continuously, they only start working if you close and reopen the lightbox over and over until they load. Suspecting it's a backend error related to the "poop" emote appearing when a random error happens with the Media Proxy. Windows 10 Pro (64-bit), Anniversary Update (Build 1607), Canary 0.0.201 (Build 10094)

### Only happens with bigger gifs, not with small ones. Try this one for example https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/217764019661045761/408255787199234058/2018-01-31_14-41-36.gif
