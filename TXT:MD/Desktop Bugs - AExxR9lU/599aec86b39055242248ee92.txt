####Steps to reproduce:
- Find some friends who are on some servers where you are 
- Check the list of common server icons next to your friends (I have this : <https://puu.sh/xfFcB/8b931c0d28.png>) 
- Go in each one of the servers you are in, until the list of members loads and displays completely 
- go back to your friend list and check the server icons (I now have this : <https://puu.sh/xfFh3/6c26b12130.png>) 
- Notice that some servers are still missing (For example with this friend : <https://puu.sh/xfFdw/aba470f52c.png>)

####Expected result:
The list should display directly without having to load the member list in each server
####Actual result:
The list doesn't display correctly unless you load the member list in each server you are in

### Not a bug, lazy loading ...

### Verified. This has nothing to do with lazy loading. Please see the pinned message about lazy loading in the Bug Hunters General chat. - Jared on 2017-08-21T20:59:09.882Z

### Our intention is to remove the mutual servers from that location due to performance reasons. - Jared on 2017-10-17T18:33:15.354Z
