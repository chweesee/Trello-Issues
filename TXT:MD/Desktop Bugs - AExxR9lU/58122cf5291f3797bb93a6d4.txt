### I think this is part of the electron bug where discord will overlap to the next screen, above and below the task bar. 

This is the issue on the electron github issue https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/5267

@jared627 as far as i know this has been happening for like 10 months at random. - Cole Norman on 2016-11-03T22:03:36.974Z
