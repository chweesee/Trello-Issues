[Archived] If you use a suggestion in the GIF Picker, you're able to scroll down and see the same suggestions briefly before it either disappears or changes to new suggestions. (https://trello.com/c/OmpWaieC)

P3: Will get fixed eventually,

Reported by Isabel#0002

####Steps to reproduce:
- Search something in the GIF Picker that would make suggestions appear at the bottom of the picker (I used "3000") 
- Scroll all the way down and wait for the suggestions to appear. ("Your perfect GIF is in another castle.") 
- Click a suggestion. 
- Scroll back to the bottom of the picker.

####Expected result:
When the picker reloads, the suggestions should regenerate before the suggestion area reappears.
####Actual result:
The same suggestions are kept on the page briefly, but noticably until they're regenerated.
####Client settings:
Canary 30756
####System settings:
MacBook Pro (13", Mid-2012), macOS v10.14.2 (Mojave)
