####Steps to reproduce:
- Be on MacOS 
- Lock your screen (ctrl+cmd+q), you shouldn't see any binoculars icon there. (unless something else is recording your screen) 
- Go back to Discord, call someone (he/she doesn't even need to accept the call), start screen sharing. 
- Before the call ends, lock your screen again, the binoculars icon is going to be there. 
- Go back to Discord, end the call and check the login screen again, icon still there. 
- Cmd+Q on Discord to finally remove the binoculars icon. (and stop whatever he is still doing)

####Expected result:
Discord should close/end whatever OS API/hook that indicates that your screen is being recorded.
####Actual result:
Discord isn't closing/ending whatever OS API/hook that indicates that your screen is being recorded.
