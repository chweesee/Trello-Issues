Reported by J1#0088

####Steps to reproduce:
- be in a server with a friend that you enabled "Show on Activity Tab" for 
- make them join a voice channel where you don't have permissions to join 
- go to your Activity Tab and observe that they're shown under Now Playing

####Expected result:
friends in voice channels you don't have access should not be shown or at least the "Join Channel" option shouldn't be there
####Actual result:
voice channels you can't join are shown as an activity with a join button that will only take you to the server
####Client settings:
Canary 34994
####System settings:
