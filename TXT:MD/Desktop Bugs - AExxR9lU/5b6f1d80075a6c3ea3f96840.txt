### Can reproduce.
CR. Macbook Air • macOS Sierra 10.12.6 • Canary 23837. I've got some steps that might help out:
- Choose the PayPal payment method, if Discord crashed now then you actually reproduced the bug already, if not continue 
- Log out 
- Enter your details 
- Log in 
- Discord crashes 
- Repeat again if you couldn't reproduce

### Can reproduce.
MacOS 10.14 Discord App for Mac 0.0.251 - Only works the first time discord launches, after the first time you try this and it fails, it seems to work without issue, but if you re-start discord it will fail again.

Appears to be a race condition issue, and depends on your client session if your client has properly initiated the paypal braintree client or not. As per this attachment: https://i.imgur.com/RyRklbA.png - Tarek on 2018-12-06T22:55:17.960Z
