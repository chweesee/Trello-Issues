Reported by Rauf#3260

####Steps to reproduce:
- Send a message to a user, then block them 
- Make a new server 
- allow modal to appear 
- hit invite 
- go to dm's with that user

####Expected result:
Nothing sends, because the user is blocked
####Actual result:
invite sends if you're the one who blocked the user, doesn't if they blocked you
####Client settings:
Canary 8746
####System settings:
