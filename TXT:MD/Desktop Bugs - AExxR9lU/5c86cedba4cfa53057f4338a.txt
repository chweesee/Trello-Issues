[Archived] When I go to mention someone from a msg they sent before they changed their name. I end up @ing the user at the time (https://trello.com/c/WBqLANh8)

P3: Will get fixed eventually

Reported by azzl/jezza#6859

####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a msg from before they have the current user they are under 
- Right click 
- Select mention 
- it should show the username they had when they sent that msg -

####Expected result:
It should automatically tag the current and correct username that they are operating under
####Actual result:
When I right click someone and mention them it uses the username that they posted under at the time. Pic provided shows current user name and where you type your msg is where it automatically tags the user as well as the 4 digits. In the pic provided the msg where I go to mention him at was 3 hours before he changed user's
