### Can reproduce.
CR, seems to be back, even worse is that this affects where the mouse is according to Discord on some button elements like the Create Invite and Edit Channel buttons on the right side of a channel (Discord thinks the mouse is way lower than it actually is, and seeing how those buttons are small it thinks you're not even hovering over the button anymore), resulting in those said buttons being nearly unusable (and thus channels can't be edited). See my gif attached. Windows 10 Pro 1709 x64, Canary 0.0.171 (Build 6880)

### The bug has come back, and also appears to be affecting the positioning of the Server Dropdown menu, the pins menu going further down (possibly cropping text) and also the member profile modal when clicking on members in the members list
