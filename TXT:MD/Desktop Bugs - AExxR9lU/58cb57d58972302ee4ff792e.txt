### Not a bug on this one. It's deliberately supposed to cut off if it gets too big. Attachments and other media do the same thing. - Jake Heinz on 2017-11-06T21:01:23.687Z


### Archiving this card because it's been in the Not a Bug list for more than a month with no new activity. - Alexandru Todea on 2017-12-09T09:06:53.873Z
