####Steps to reproduce:
- create a server
- On the create server modal, upload a server icon (size does not matter, but it's easiest recreateable with squared pictures or "banners")

####Expected result:
The picture is centered and there are no edges
####Actual result:
The picture is off-center, leaving a line at the top and the left side of the icon
####Client settings:
Desktop Canary, Build 10018, Version 0.0.201
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro x64, Build 16299, Version 10.0.16299

### Can reproduce.
CR Canary 10018, Win7 Ultimate, I actually used a friend’s server for this and saw the effect.  It seems to not be visible on images that don’t take up the whole server icon, should be a full icon image.
