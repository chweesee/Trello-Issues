####Steps to reproduce:
- Set a new custom status that clears after some time (tested with clearance after 30 minutes) 
- Set a new custom status before the first one clears (tested with "Don't Clear") 
- Status still clears after the specified time of the first status (so 30 minutes after setting the first status in my test)

####Expected result:
Status clearance timeframe should reset to the new timeframe or shouldn't clear at all if "Don't Clear" is selected
####Actual result:
The status clears after the timeframe of the first set status
