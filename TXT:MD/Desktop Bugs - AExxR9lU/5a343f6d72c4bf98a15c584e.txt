### Can reproduce.
Tested it out with three other bug hunters. You can see the camera freezing and tearing up if you move too much with at least four people in the video call. Windows 10 Pro, Fall Creator Update, Discord Canary Build 8612.

### Apparently, the bug could not be reproduced by the original reproduction steps. Let's try this new set of reproduction steps: 
- Join the video call with at least 3 or 4 people (including yourself.) 
- Turn on webcam
- Move around a lot, preferly around the left side of your webcam.
- Observe. 
It may not look like it will do much, but if you start to wave around or move a lot, you will see the screen to freeze up on the left side of the screen showing your webcam.

### I believe this was fixed in a recent update. One of the builds seem to make the split screen view zoomed in, creating the screen tearing/freezing on the edges, but as of the current build, the proportions have been fixed so this doesn't happen now.
