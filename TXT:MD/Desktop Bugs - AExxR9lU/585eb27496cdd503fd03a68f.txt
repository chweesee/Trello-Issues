####Steps to reproduce: 
- Have two people react to a message 
- Hover over the reaction to show the usernames (`User1 and User2 reacted with :emoji:`) 
- Without moving your mouse and losing the popup, have one user remove their reaction, so only one reaction remains 

####Expected result:
 The message should change from `User1 and User2 reacted with :emoji:` to `User1 reacted with :emoji:` 
####Actual result:
 The message changes from `User1 and User2 reacted with :emoji:` to `User1 and 1 other reacted with :emoji:` (implying that there are 2 total reactions, not just one). By moving your mouse (and leaving the popup), and returning, the correct message is displayed. Example of the incorrect message: <http://i.imgur.com/knDGSPr.png>

### This is another instance of things not updating until the start of an event, in this case mouse hover start. I don't think it's even technically possible to fix and even if it is it's not high enough priority to dedicated resources to fixing. - Jared on 2017-01-03T18:54:05.212Z
