####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a voice channel lower down on the channel list, and one higher up separated by other text channels so that while viewing the lower voice channel the higher one is not visible 
- Have an unread notification between the lower voice channel and the higher voice channel 
- Try to move the user by dragging them to the top of the channel list to scroll up to the higher voice channel

####Expected result:
The channel list should scroll upwards
####Actual result:
The channel list does not scroll upwards as it is blocked by the Unread Messages notification bubble
