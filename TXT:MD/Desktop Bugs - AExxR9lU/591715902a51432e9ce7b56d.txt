### It does show up briefly, but then goes away. Regardless, this is not a P2. - Jared on 2017-10-16T21:57:02.738Z

### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Pro 1607 x64, Canary 0.0.165 (build 5843) -- But only on older servers (it stays), recently created ones the notification goes away quickly.

### On newer Servers the dialog appears but direclty hides, on older servers, probably older then one year, the bug still appears completely so the dialog stays.
