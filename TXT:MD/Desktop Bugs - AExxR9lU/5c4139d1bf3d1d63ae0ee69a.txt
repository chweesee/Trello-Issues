####Steps to reproduce:
- Change language 
- Try the help button from the options (top bar mac). We can see that the language is taken into account 
- Do the same with the button that is directly in discord

####Expected result:
The help button in discord should take into account the language change as well as the help button of the options
####Actual result:
The help button in discord does not take into account the language change so between the 2 button, not same language
