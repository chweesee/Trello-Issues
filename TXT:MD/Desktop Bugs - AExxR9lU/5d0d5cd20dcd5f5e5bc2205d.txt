Reported by Tarek#1337

####Steps to reproduce:
- Be in a guild with this experimental feature 
- Ask someone to make a channel you don't have access to 
- Tell them to set a custom status in there 
- Observe how you still get a notification about joining them, and when joining you are semi added to the VC and you can see people, and hear them leave and join. But not their voices

####Expected result:
You should not get a notification nor be able to join the VC that way
####Actual result:
You get a notification about a private VC, can see the members inside it and hear people joining/leaving
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.245 (40201)
####System settings:
