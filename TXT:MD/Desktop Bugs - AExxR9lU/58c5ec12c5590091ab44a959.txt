####Steps to reproduce: 
- Open a server and post a link to another channel 
- Delete said other channel 
- Return to post and attempt to visit now nonexistent channel 
- Listen to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGNiXGX2nLU as the client sits forever trying to load channel. 

####Expected result:
 It just doesn't link, or changes the hyperlink to #deleted-channel like it normally would 
####Actual result:
 Client has fun trying to figure out exactly what happened
