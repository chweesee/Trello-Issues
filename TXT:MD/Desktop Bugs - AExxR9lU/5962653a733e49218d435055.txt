Reported by Pointy#5565

####Steps to reproduce:
- Ensure you have the report experiment enabled (this report can't be reproduced without it) 
- Invoke Clyde somehow (e.g. sending a message to someone that has you blocked, setting your nickname via /nick, etc.) 
- Right click the message Clyde throws

####Expected result:
No report option is available since Clyde is only a client side message
####Actual result:
Report option is visible and opens the report UI if clicked, however gets stuck in an infinite load loop (can be exited)
####Client settings:
Desktop Canary 0.0.157 (Build 2137)
####System settings:
Win 10 Pro x64 v1607
