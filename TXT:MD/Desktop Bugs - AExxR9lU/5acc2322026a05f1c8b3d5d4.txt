####Steps to reproduce:
- Start listening on Spotify 
- Send a Spotify Embed in a channel 
- Get someone to listen along 
- Start playing a game so the Spotify rich presences goes off your profile 
- The other person should still be listen along 
- Try skipping a song on shuffle or change to a different playlist or something 
- The other person should still be "attached" so they are still listening with you 
- Check the embed again and in the corner where you change to online/Idle/DnD etc, and see that the other person's profile picture isn't there and yet they are still listening along/

####Expected result:
They should disconnect after the other person changes to something different.
####Actual result:
The person is still "attached" and listening along
