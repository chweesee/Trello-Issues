####Steps to reproduce:
- Create (or rename) a role so that it is very long (128 Ws work well) 
- Try to create a channel with the create channel modal 
- Set "private channel" to true 
- Notice how the long role name is cut off, and clicking on the long role name horizontally scrolls the inside of the modal, with no way to scroll back

####Expected result:
The role name should be truncated to the width of the modal
####Actual result:
The role name extends beyond the modal's width
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 31642
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home 1809
