####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a server and delete all channels and channel categories.

It opens up the invite modal with an invite link that displays no invite code, and the friends list remains in a state of perpetual loading.

### I'm very very very doubtful this is even a bug. Since it has never been possible to generate an invite link to a server w/o text channels. 

Waiting for a dev to verify. - Tarek on 2018-04-12T06:05:51.164Z


### Ack on this one. The bug here is simply that we allow that modal to open. - Jake Heinz on 2018-04-12T06:33:51.413Z
