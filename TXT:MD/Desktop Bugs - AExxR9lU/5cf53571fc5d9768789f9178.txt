Reported by Gorgeouser Georgeous#9779

####Steps to reproduce:
- Click (in the menu bar) Discord > About Discord 
- Press cmd-w (âŒ˜W)

####Expected result:
The About Discord window should close, Discord itself should not (because the About window is topmost and has focus)
####Actual result:
All windows are closed _together_, and the About Discord window reappears when the main Discord window is reopened
####Client settings:
