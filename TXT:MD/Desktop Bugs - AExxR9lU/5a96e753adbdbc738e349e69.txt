[Archived] With autocomplete suggestions, after you've clicked on a suggestion to complete your `:emojiname:` for an example, and do `ctrl + z`, it will start removing from what you've typed in before you've clicked on a suggestion instead of removing the whole `:emojiname:`. Same with all autocomplete suggestions. (https://trello.com/c/RZSW31QO)

P3: Will get fixed eventually,

Reported by nuke#1337

####Steps to reproduce:
- Use emoji matching to complete an emoji name 
- Do `ctrl + z`

####Expected result:
Doing `ctrl + z` removes the whole emoji name.
####Actual result:
It starts removing from what you've typed in before autocompleting and doesn't remove the autocomplete portion up until there is nothing else behind it to remove.
####Client settings:

####System settings:
