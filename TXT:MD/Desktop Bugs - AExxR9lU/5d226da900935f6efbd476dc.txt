Reported by Travus#8888

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to channel permissions 
- See the list of members with overwrites 
- Compare with mobile device or other users 
- Realize that 3 of the mods and my mobile all have different incomplete lists. 
- Notice that the missing users do exists, because trying to add them doesn't work as they are already in the list and can't be found, but are invisible to you.

####Expected result:
You should see all users that have channel overwrites in the channel permission section.
####Actual result:
You may be missing some of the people with overwrites.
####Client settings:
