####Steps to Reproduce:
- Type and send a message consisting of these three things on different lines:
- `<`
- A web link
- Anything represented as `<ID>` on Discord's end (a member or role ping, channel call, emoji, etc)

####Expected Result:
The message should appear as sent.
####Actual Result:
The formatting is incorrect in one of a couple different ways:
The message appears as a web link that's `https://ID`
The message appears as web link that's the correct web link with `%0A%C3 ID` appended after the last slash
The web link becomes unclickable, and the mention gets truncated as `<ID`
Note that in all cases the link embeds correctly, and any role or member ping still occurs.#`". Note that this still pings the person.

### I previously thought this bug was something to do with the "Automatically convert emoticons" setting. This is not the case.
