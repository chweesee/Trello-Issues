**Steps to Reproduce:**

- Make sure you're not idle/invisible/DnD
- Have someone send you a friend request or accept yours with the Desktop Client open and your phone with push notifications enabled.

**Expected Result:**
The notification shouldn't happen because the Desktop Client is open, stopping push notifications,

**Actual Result:**
You are sent a push notification on both devices at exactly the same time.

**System Settings:**
Huawei Y560, CM13 (Android 6.0.1)
