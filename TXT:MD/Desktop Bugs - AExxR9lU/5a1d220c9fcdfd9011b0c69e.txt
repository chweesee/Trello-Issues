####Steps to reproduce:
- Send someone a link of a stream in a personal chat, make them watch it and when the ad is about to show up the discord app crashes and restarts. It was just a regular friend of mine who sent the message, not a blocked user.

####Expected result:
Discord plays the  stream without crashing and just normally shows the ad.
####Actual result:
Discord crashes and restarts.
####Client settings:
Dutch, last regular stable build I think. (is it 0.0.298?)
####System settings:
Dutch Windows 10 Home x64
