[Archived] If you type another letter into the invite DM box which causes no results to be found while scrolled down, there is a high chance the black bar separating the search bar and the selection area does not go away until another letter is typed again. (https://trello.com/c/ybev0uRR)

P3: Will get fixed eventually,

Reported by 54D [Hibernation]#1357

####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a combination of search terms that cause the results page go from scrollable to no results once you type another character. 
- In my case, typing one "b" filters some results, and the selection area is scrollable. Typing another "b" immediately gives me no results. Make sure this is met first!! 
- Clear your input. Type whatever first character you entered first. 
- Scroll down the selection area and make sure the black bar pops up. It only appears when you are scrolled down. 
- Press that character that makes you get no result. In my case, it's the second "b" character. 
- The below

####Expected result:
Black bar disappears since there is no results and nowhere to scroll.
####Actual result:
Black bar stays there, blocking the beautiful magnifying glass.
