Reported by 𝅳𝅳𝅳𝅳𝅳#5756

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Try to upload an image. Fill in the text box until there's just enough room to partially display a channel name. 
- Select a channel that will overflow the textbox size. Spacebar at the end in order for it to reset to the proper display. 

####Expected result:
 The channel name properly displays, and goes to a new-line if need be. 
####Actual result:
 No new line. 
####System settings:
 Windows 10 Pro. [For Enharmonic#3999 UID 114189842513920002]
