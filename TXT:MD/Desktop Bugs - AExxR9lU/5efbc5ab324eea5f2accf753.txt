Reported by Cerberus#0005

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have two servers: Discoverable server and server 2 
- Have a Discoverable server with a followable Announcement channel 
- Follow the announcement channel from discoverable server into a separate server 
- Click the "has followed channel" system message with a user not in the discoverable server 
- Go to server settings and disable "Discoverable" 
- Click the "has followed channel" system message again 
- Click "View Server"

####Expected result:
It should just fail.
####Actual result:
It does not fail, client becomes randomly laggy, and client randomly spams 404 errors especially when switching servers, trying to leave the discoverable server... which it's not in.
