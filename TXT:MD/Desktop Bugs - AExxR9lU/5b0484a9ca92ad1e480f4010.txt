####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a point in message history far back enough to have 'You're viewing older messages' at the bottom of the screen  
- Right-click and select edit 
- Press escape key to cancel

####Expected result:
For the message to go back into normal mode but not to scroll at all; this is what happens when selecting 'cancel' with the mouse instead
####Actual result:
An abrupt jump to most recent messages. If done from a search, the chat scrolls very quickly to the most recent messages.
####Client settings:
Desktop app main release, updated on May 18th 2018
####System settings:
Windows 10 x64
