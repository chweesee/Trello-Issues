### This bug was fixed as of yesterday but when I noticed the fix, my Spotify client had an update. As far as I know, no build was rolled out to PTB/Stable for the spotify link crash yet, so potentially, this has been fixed by Spotify and is not actually a discord bug. This ideally would need to be investigated to verify.
