Reported by SightlessKombat#0701

####Steps to reproduce:
- Using NVDA on Windows 10, go into discord. 
- The first screen after the client loads should just read as blank blank blank when pressing up and down arrows, with the occasional reading of "dialogue. 
- Find the line that says "dialogue" and press enter on it, at which point the tutorial message or other content should clear and allow for correct browsing of the window, even if some elements aren't interacting correctly (something for future bug reports).

####Expected result:
The tutorial messages should read and be dismissable via keyboard commands with a screen reader, but aren't at present
####Actual result:
Nothing reads with the screen reader until enter is pressed on "dialogue"
