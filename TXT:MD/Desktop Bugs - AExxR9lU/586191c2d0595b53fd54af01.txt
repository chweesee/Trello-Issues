####Steps to reproduce: 
- Buy sweet, sweet Discord Nitro 
- Go onto a server where external emojis are disabled 
- ensure that this is the first time youve seen the discord nitro message from clyde as thats how the discord (sort of) tutorial works 
- type an external emoji 

####Expected result:
 Clyde tells me that external emojis are disabled 
####Actual result:
 - Clyde eats my wumpus and asks me to buy Nitro, instead of saying you cant post external emojis
