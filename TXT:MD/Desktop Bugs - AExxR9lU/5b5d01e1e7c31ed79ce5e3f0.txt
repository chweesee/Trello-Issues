####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Discord 
- Go to a Discord server that has a lot of notifications 
- While you're in the server that has unread messages, right click one of the unread channels and press mark as read, you'll notice that when you left click on that chat, you won't be taken to the bottom of the chat

####Expected result:
The user should be brought to the latest message from the channel no matter what.
####Actual result:
The user is stuck in the middle of the chat and stuck there until the user sends a message.
