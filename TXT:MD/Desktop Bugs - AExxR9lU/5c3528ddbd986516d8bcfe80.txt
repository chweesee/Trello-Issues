####Steps to reproduce:
- Type any emoji such as üö™ in the input 
- Move the caret anywhere in the emoji and press Tab to complete the emoji 
- Repeatedly use the Undo hotkey 
- Repeatedly use the Redo hotkey

####Expected result:
If the caret were inside a complete and correct completeable such as üî¥ and Enter were pressed, the message would be sent as-is. If the completeable were incorrect, but correctable, such as :pes:, the completion tooltip would show üçá as it does now, and move the caret after the complete emoji when upon pressing Enter
####Actual result:
Upon pressing Enter while the caret is between the "oo" in üö™, the :do completes to üöØ or:. Undoing results in an inconsistent state. Redoing a few times results in the following uncaught exception:
