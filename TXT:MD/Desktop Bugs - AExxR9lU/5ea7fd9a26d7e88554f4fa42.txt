Bad things happen when nitro expires, you've picked a custom tag, and your name has 9999 other people with it. (https://trello.com/c/uFHeHqLb)

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have discord nitro 
- Pick short name with only 1 available number left (this is hard to reproduce, i'll grant you!) 
- Let nitro expire 
- Discord will try to reallocate your tag number when on any api call to a /users/@me endpoint 
- This call will fail with the error "{"username": ["Too many users have this username, please try another."]}"" 
- This isn't usually an issue unless you try to update something about yourself, but, if you're sent an "important message from discord" and try to acknowledge that, it goes to /users/@me, and fails, so you're effectively locked out of discord until you pay for nitro again.

####Expected result:
Discord is able to reallocate your tag number.
####Actual result:
Error (as detailed) to any /users/@me call.
####Client settings:
Happens on anything. Mobile, Web, Desktop as it's API based.
####System settings:
Any
