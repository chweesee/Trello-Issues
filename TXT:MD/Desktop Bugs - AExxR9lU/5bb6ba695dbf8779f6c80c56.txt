Reported by Boobah#1991

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to your server settings 
- Remove the server name, don't click save. 
- Click Delete Server 
- The confirmation box will pop up asking you to type the server name. You don't have to type anything though and can click Delete Server because you removed the name.

####Expected result:
It should ask you to enter the server name that is saved, not the unsaved one.
####Actual result:
You can delete the server without entering the server name.
####Client settings:
