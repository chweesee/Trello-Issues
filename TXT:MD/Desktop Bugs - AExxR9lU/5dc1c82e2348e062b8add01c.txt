Reported by RPS1222#5127

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open discord (obviously) 
- open another window smaller than discord that overlaps at the member list of a discord server and select this tab 
- Hover your mouse on the selected tab quickly over a user on the discord member list (don't click!) 
- You might need to try a few of times, but it should only take one or two tries

####Expected result:
Like what happens on windows where the person stays highlighted when you hover over them
####Actual result:
You see a flicker of the user being highlighted, but it quickly goes away
####Client settings:
Canary Build 48586
####System settings:
MacBook Air (10.15 Catalina)
