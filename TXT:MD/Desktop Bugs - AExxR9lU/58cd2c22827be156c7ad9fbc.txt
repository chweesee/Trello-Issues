Reported by Feierwoerx#9761

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Make a message that has almost or exactly 2000 characters (Character Limit) and include a mention of a channel or user in it. Example: "BlaBla [...] Bla#my-channel" 
- Send it to any discord channel (Make sure the channel/user exists) 
- Enjoy the redness 

####Expected result:
 The message appears or you get an error message that it did not work 
####Actual result:
 The message turns red and you do not get an error message. This is probably because Discord will interpret your #my-channel mention as <#my-channel-id> making it way longer, longer than 2000 chars. Because of that it won't send. 
####System settings:
 Linux Chrome Web App

### I swear I commented on this already. Weird. Anyway, the message is over 2000 characters because things like #general are sent through the server as <#394230492432893094> or whatever. Not a bug. - Jared on 2017-03-21T21:53:52.344Z
