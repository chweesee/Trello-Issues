### Technically we haven't rolled out transparent PNG avatars, yet. We support them being uploaded, but we have not yet started sending them to the client. - Amadeus on 2017-01-20T19:41:16.994Z


### Tested on latest canary as of writing:

I can no longer reproduce this. To my knowledge, and from what I've seen, transparent PNG's are being rolled out to the clients for a while now. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-04-25T02:04:08.108Z


### Verified Fixed. - Jared on 2017-07-28T19:41:40.718Z
