Reported by Enharmonic#3999

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Start streamer mode 
- Attempt to search using a from: filter or a mentions: filter 

####Expected result:
 Search behaves like normal mentions do in streamer mode, and shows a list of usernames and avatars, just without the discrims. 
####Actual result:
 The search filters become completely disabled. Even manually typing them does not work.

### Won't fix.

There is no way to remove the user discrims from the search. It's not chat, it's like a screenshot of what happened. - Jared on 2017-01-17T21:13:06.027Z
