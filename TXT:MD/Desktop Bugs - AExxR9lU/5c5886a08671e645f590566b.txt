[Archived] Unlike for static emotes, messages in servers cannot be searched via the name of an animated emote it contains. (https://trello.com/c/Ev0mQs7I)

P3: Will get fixed eventually,

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go in any server where you can manage emojis 
- Create a new static emote and name it "abcdef"  
- Send a message containing the emote in this server 
- Do Ctrl+F and type in "abcdef". Notice how your message containing the emote shows up in search results 
- Now create a new emote, *animated* this time. Name it let's say "uvwxyz"  
- Send a message containing this animated emote 
- Do Ctrl + F again and search for "uvwxyz"

####Expected result:
The message containing the animated emote should show up in the results
####Actual result:
The message doesn't show up. Apparently it works if you prepend the emote name with "a:" in your search query, but I don't see why it would be required since the search engine usually ignores special characters like ":"
