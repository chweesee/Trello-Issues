**Short Description:** The timestamp next to messages is able to be hovered over when in a Discord popup like user cards and when Discord is not the focused application even though the timestamp it self is not visible.
**Steps to reproduce:**
- Send multiple messages in chat without anyone breaking up your message group.
- Open up a user card by clicking on someones name or another program.
- While the user card or program is open and over chat, hover your mouse over where the time stamp would be.

**Expected Results:** The timestamp hover popup should not display while chat is out of focus.
**Actual Results:** The timestamp hover popup displays.

**Client Settings:** Discord Canary Build: 53527 (c62e2a4)
**System Settings:** Windows 10 Home x64 1909
