Reported by TheForbiddenAi#0403

####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a channel with a long topic or send a really long message 
- Observe how the members list and various other options are gone due to the channel topic being untruncated

####Expected result:
The channel topic is truncated/long message gets wrapped
####Actual result:
The channel topic is untruncated and the long messages are unwrapped causing the members list and various other options to be pushed off the side
####Client settings:
