[Archived] Image urls with escaped characters (like %20 for space) dont generate a preview and dont show up in bot embeds while image urls with no escaped characters work fine (https://trello.com/c/KC23XtND)

P3: Will get fixed eventually,

Reported by Strum355#1180

####Steps to reproduce:
- In bot: have image url 
- Escape it (eg space -> %20) 
- Send url as user or in embed as bot

####Expected result:
Image should be shown. As url from user, url + image should show up
####Actual result:
Image isnt shown. As user, url only is shown without image. As bot, the embed is empty. As can be seen in the attached images below, only one of the links shows a preview. This also causes bot embeds that contain said images to not display an image
####Client settings:
Discord Linux 0.0.2 deb and Android 4.0.2
####System settings:
LG G3 Android 6.0 and Linux Mint 18
