Reported by Pascal#0929

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open the search for any server (very big server like Discord Testers is better) 
- Use the `mentions:` or `from:` filter 
- Start typing the name of any user that might be uncached (you could find some old user names with bug bot's messages) 
- Observe the user suggestions to search for

####Expected result:
The user should get instantly cached when typing the name.
####Actual result:
It doesn't get cached. There is only a workaround to get the user instantly cached by removing the space between the search filter and the user input (`from:{user}` instead `from: {user}`)
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.191 (Build 15598)
####System settings:
MacBook Pro 13" (2016), macOS High Sierra 10.13.4
