####Steps to reproduce:
- Be in a server where you don't have create channels permission (the + button next to category names mustn't be there) 
- Pick any category in this server containing only text channels (no voice)  
- Mute all channels in this category.  
- Go to server menu and click "Hide muted channels"

####Expected result:
The muted channels disappear and the category should be now empty
####Actual result:
The whole category is gone, despite having permission to view the category.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 10015
####System settings:
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Asus Netbook F551C, Intel Core i3 64bits

### To be honest I'm not sure whether this is the intended bahavior or not, because this bug also happens on Android. However, the exact opposite bug has been reported before and it got archived because NAB: https://trello.com/c/JKxT9FcH/

Btw I originally wrote this report for Android that's why I used words like "Pressing" in short descrption, I just forgot to change that when posting it in Desktop bug reports.

### I am moving this ticket to Not a Bug because I really don't see how this is a bug. Technically, what you are doing is that you are literally hiding all of the channels in one category which doesn't really gives a reason why the category should appear if there are hidden channels. (Also confirmed with Dabbit about this ticket.) - Ghoul on 2018-07-05T23:21:38.969Z
