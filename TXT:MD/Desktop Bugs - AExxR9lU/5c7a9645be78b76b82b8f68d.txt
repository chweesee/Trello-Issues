####Steps to reproduce:
- Sign in _on the desktop app_ on an account where you have never a) authorized an application or b) visited the streamkit overlay on  
- Go to settings > authorized apps. Notice the empty state that says "no authorized apps" (picture 1)  
- Go to the Streamkit Overlay 
- Click on one of the install buttons  
- Wait until the list of servers you're in appears _(note: you may have to reload the page and repeat this step. the streamkit overlay is finicky) _ 
- Go back to settings > authorized apps. Notice how there is no empty state (picture 2)

####Expected result:
There should be an empty state. No applications are shown (the streamkit app is hidden)
####Actual result:
The empty state is not present
