### Can reproduce.
CR, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 Pro, Discord Canary Build 9052. | Please make sure you select the window instead of doing the  whole screen in order to reproduce the said bug. Also, use 720 or 1080 (on the highest settings). Also, I actually think for Windows 10 that 720 (60) can reproduce that bug, but Windows 8.1 / 7 would reproduce with all high settings.

### Can reproduce.
CR, Discord Canary 0.0.194, Build 9052, Windows 10 Home x64 | 720 (60) indeed reproduces it on Windows 10, I tried 1080 and it did not reproduce it.
