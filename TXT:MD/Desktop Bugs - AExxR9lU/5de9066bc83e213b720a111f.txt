Reported by TheForbiddenAi#0403

####Steps to reproduce:
- Start streaming in a server with multiple VCs 
- From either mobile or web join that same vc so it kicks you out on the desktop client 
- From the desktop client click the start streaming button and observe how it only shows the channel you were previously in 
- Now leave that VC from mobile or web (which ever one you chose) 
- Reopen the start streaming menu from the desktop client 
- Observe how there only the VC you were previously in is still there, until you join that vc and leave

####Expected result:
All VCs should show
####Actual result:
Only the previous VC you were in before being kicked out shows
####Client settings:
