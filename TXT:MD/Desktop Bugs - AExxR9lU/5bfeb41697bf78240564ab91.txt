####Steps to reproduce:

- Post, or search for, a message containing a discord store link. 
- Observe role colours in the chat.

####Expected result:
Colours would remain normal.
####Actual result:
Colours change very obviously while embed is loaded (similar to typing indicators causing issues in members list).
####Client settings:
Canary 0.0.224 (Build 28516)
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro (64-bit), Creators Update (v1709, Build 16299.547)

### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Enterprise 1803, Canary 28516; I am noticing a different effect with this, instead of the role colour changing, the font seems to become thinner.

### I told Sajuuk to report this. I doubt this is the ancient Electron bug.
Seems so random that it's specific to store embeds. And apparently it happened to regular image embeds 1+ year ago. - Tarek on 2018-11-28T20:48:35.612Z
