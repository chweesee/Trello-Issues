Reported by Ghoul#0009

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a bot where you can change username, or find one yourself. (A bot with a playing status would work the best.)
- Change the bot's username to something long (i.e. ~ DiscordTestersStream or DiscordTestersTesting) 
- Click on their profile to view their mini-profile. 
- Observe.

####Expected result:
Bot Tag should be showed fully.
####Actual result:
Bot Tag either gets cut off and show nothing else, or cut off and have the part of the tag to go into a new line.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary Build 20386
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64 (Version 1803)
