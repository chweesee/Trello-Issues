Reported by Ene#0808

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go into a channel with enough messages to scroll up in 
- Be on a Chat Font Scaling below <150 
- Go into your User Settings -> Appearance and change your Chat Font Scaling to one greater than your currently set one 
- Close your User Settings and observe your currently scrolled position in chat

####Expected result:
Your current scrolled position is kept in place
####Actual result:
You get scrolled up in the chat and for some reason pressing the ESC key refuses to scroll you back down to the bottom of chat unless you switch to another channel and back
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.211, Build 19429
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home 64-bit (v1709)

### This is a bug, but it's not new to our message update. We need to handle scroll position better when changing text scaling. - Joey Baker on 2018-07-23T22:05:18.394Z
