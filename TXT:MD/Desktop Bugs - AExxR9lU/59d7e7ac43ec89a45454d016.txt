####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a channel setttings tab, create an invite (which will stay for 24 hours by default) 
- Then create a permanent invite. 
- Then untick the "Set this link to never expire" 
- Then click on the gear icon on the create invite menu and then create an invite.

####Expected result:
The "Expire After" would be 24 hours (which is default)
####Actual result:
The "Expire After" becomes 30 Minutes (Which is not default)
