Reported by Rashaun#9295

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a server where you can manage webhooks 
- Create a new webhook 
- Select a channel with a long name (I used one that created a second line in the channel selector modal) 
- Observe where the ellipses meets the dropdown arrow 
- Click on the arrow to open the channel selector modal and observe the ellipses, to verify that there are three dots there 
- Click the arrow again to close the dropdown menu, and observe the number of dots

####Expected result:
The channel name ellipses before reaching the dropdown arrow, so the ellipses is fully visible
####Actual result:
The channel name ellipses too close to the dropdown arrow, causing the ellipses to disappear behind the arrow
