####Steps to reproduce:
- Join/Start a call with at least 3 people 
- Talk with your buddies for some time 
- Leave the call **by pressing the red button** (!) 
- Then, *SOMETIMES* the following happens: Your avatar dissappears in an animation and the red "leave call" button becomes a green "join call" button. But at the bottom left corner at the discord window you can see, that you are still connected to the call. The people in the call can still hear you, you can hear them and for them you did not leave

####Expected result:
You actually left the call
####Actual result:
I wrote what happens in the steps to repro because here was too little space.
