I also found that if you open the search window, (so it covers the memberlist) the embed won't lag at all... I don't know how it's related but yea.

### Okey, I found something odd..

Apparently fullscreening videos in big guilds, or fullscreening in general makes the Discord client start loading in every user avatar, it's easy to see it by opening the network tab on the Discord client and observe all the image loading. As shown in the GIF: https://i.imgur.com/OdiZSPx.gifv
Apox 6k requests for downloading avatars. And there is 6,6k online users at the time in DTesters, probably 600 invisible users.
