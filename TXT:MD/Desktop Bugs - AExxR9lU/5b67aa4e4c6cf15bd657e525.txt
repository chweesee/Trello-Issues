[Archived] If you open in browser an invite link formatted as `discord(dot)gg/XXXX` with XXXX containing invalid characters (such as ' or &), you will be taken to discord's website homepage, while it does display the invalid invite screen if you're using the `discordapp(dot)com/invite/XXXX` format of same invite (https://trello.com/c/DOAXhO58)

P3: Will get fixed eventually,
