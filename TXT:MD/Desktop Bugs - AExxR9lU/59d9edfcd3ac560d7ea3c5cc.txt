Reported by AEnterprise#4693

####Steps to reproduce:
- go to a channel with unread messages 
- use shift+esc to mark the entire server as read 
- notice that the red line is still there (if there where a lot of messages and it scrolled you down just scroll up again to to find it)

####Expected result:
the red line marker is removed (like it does when you mark just the channel as read with esc)
####Actual result:
the new messages red line stays untill you go to another channel and return or mark the channel as read with esc
####Client settings:
canary 0.0.164, build 5517
####System settings:
Windows 10 x64
