####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to desktop settings > Billing 
- Click on "Add Payment Method" > "Paypal" 
- In the browser tab that is opening, click on "Cancel and return to Discord Inc."

####Expected result:
A Discord browser tab should be opening to say that we canceled the adding of the PayPal details.
####Actual result:
A Discord browser tab is opening saying that the adding of the PayPal details succeeded.

### Can reproduce.
I just want to add that I cannot reproduce this on an account with no billing information. However, on this account that has a Nitro subscription (and billing information), I can reproduce this. Perhaps this is only for people who have billing information on their accounts? And I guess it would make sense for wonderful Clayton down there to not be able to reproduce it as they may not need to have billing information in the first place lol MacBook Pro: macOS Catalina 10.15.2; Discord Canary 51469
