### Hotfixed by opening mixer in razer synapse and changing audio slider to another position then back

### Can reproduce.
macOS 10.12.6  This happens but it's worse in the new build. Sounds like a helecopter on steriods and voice channels sound quality sounds worse than a broken record. Makes discord unusable. On the most recent both stable (0.0248) and canary build (0.0.154) but not the last stable build.

### We've narrowed this down to a problem with Synapse. It installs "audio enhancements" that sometimes get corrupted during initial installation. Reinstalling Synapse has fixed this issue in previous situations. - Jared on 2017-08-09T16:32:48.834Z
