### It is now happening in iOS, expect that the Discord embed is showing up. I can reproduce on iPhone 8 +, iOS 11.3 PB2 and Discord TestFlight 2.2.3 (2671)

### This Bug also now is reproduceable if you add any special symbol like *()\/]. Directly behind the Invite. It also happens on all Clients and OS.
