As soon as go Full screen all controls of the youtube window freeze quiting discord doesn't help I have to force exit it thorugh task manager. task manager show the memory keeps increasing from 150~mb up to 450~mb and probably even further if you keep it running, even after the video is done playing.

### It usually just lags your discord majorly anytime you fullscreen. Depending on how patient you are determines whether it crashes or not.
