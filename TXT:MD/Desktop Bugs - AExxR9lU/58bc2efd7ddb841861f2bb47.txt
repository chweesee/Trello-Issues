Reported by Ryu#1129

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Have someone DM you who has never DMed you before 
- Have them delete the DM before you can check it 

####Expected result:
 Checking it should get rid of the red notification 
####Actual result:
 Red notification stays there and does not go away 
####System settings:
 Mint 17.3 XFCE using lastest Discord client.  I was told to report this in general bug channel because it happens on all clients.
