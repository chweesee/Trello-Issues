####Steps to reproduce:
- scroll down your server list 
- click on a server 
- receive a DM 
- click on the "new" notification at the top of your server list 
- observe that you are still looking at the server and not the DM

####Expected result:
When you click on the "new" notification does not make you scroll up the server list and go to the DM you received
####Actual result:
Nothing changes and while it indicates you clicked on the notification, you do not scroll up or go to the DM
####Client settings:

### Pretty sure this should be fixed in the current Canary? Please don't move it since what is on Canary currently could get blown away and this bug would return. - Amadeus on 2019-06-18T04:51:03.788Z
