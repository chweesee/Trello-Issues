####Steps to reproduce: 
- Have a channel require a specific role to access, and ensure a moderator has Manage Channels perm 
- Make sure the moderator does not have the required role to view it so it's hidden from him or her 
- Have the user long click or slight drag on the channel below the hidden one. 
- If done correctly, the channel they moved should be above the hidden one now despite them not being able to see it. 

####Expected result:
 Channel shouldn't move above the hidden one. 
####Actual result:
 Channel gets moved above hidden one There's now a ghost in your discord moving channels 
####System settings:
 Windows 10 Pro Discord PTB, Browser
