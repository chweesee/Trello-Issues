####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Audit Log/Members in Server Settings for any server you have permissions for 
- Attempt to change the "Filter by User", "Filter by Action", or "Display Role:" selectors. 
- you expect the height of the selector be unlimited and the scroll bar not be where it should be.

####Expected result:
Menu opens, height is limited, allows you to scroll through options.
####Actual result:
Menu opens, height is unlimited, there's no scroll bar.
####Client settings:
