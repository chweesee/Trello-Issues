####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to server discovery, make sure it's open 
- CLICK on the Add a Server button 
- Click on Create a Server 
- Set the server name to anything, customize it to how you want it. 
- Note how it takes a while to create the server / maybe causes you to get stuck 
- The server DOES get created 
- HOW TO FIX, Quit Canary by right-clicking on the icon in the dock.

####Expected result:
Server gets created as normal and menu goes down and takes you into the VC.
####Actual result:
The menu makes you get stuck and you can't do anything except quit Discord.
####Client settings:
