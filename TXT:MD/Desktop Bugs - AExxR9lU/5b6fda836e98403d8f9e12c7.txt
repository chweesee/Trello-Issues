####Steps to reproduce:
- Be on the Web Client
 
- Change Language to Chinese (China)

####Expected result:
All Symbols are in one Line
####Actual result:
The Symbol with "download app" is not in the same row as the other Server Symbols. This is due to a Symbol being next to it, moving it.
####Client settings:
Web Client
####System settings:
Win 10 x64 ; Opera 54
