####Steps to reproduce:
- Start up a call 
- Open Discord on another device or in another window 
- Connect to the same call

####Expected result:
Discord should recognize that you're no longer in the call on that device and turn off the webcam appropriately.
####Actual result:
Discord fails to turn off the webcam, leaving it and the activity light on.
####Client settings:
Stable 22658
####System settings:
Windows (1709 Home and 1803 Pro)

### It appears this is the API used when disconnecting:
https://github.com/discordapp/discord/blob/master/discord_app/stores/MediaEngineStore.js#L203-L205

So `setVideoInputDevice` is invoked with the string `'disabled'`
