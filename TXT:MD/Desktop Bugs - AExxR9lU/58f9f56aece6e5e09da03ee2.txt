### A related issue to this one (that others believed to be duplicate) is that the "Upload Image" button is not properly hidden/disabled for a user that has permissions to reach the Server Overview screen, but not to change the picture. The image goes through the upload process, then a 403 is thrown when "Save Changes" is clicked.
