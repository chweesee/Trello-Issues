####Steps to reproduce:
- Setup and train Windows Speech Recognition to allow it to understand your voice 
- Go into any Discord Server with multiple Text Channels 
- use the Wake Word "Start Listening" 
- use the Voice Command "Show Numbers" 
- Say the number of the Text Channel you want followed by "OK" to confirm (such as "6", "OK") 
- Say the name of another Text Channel 
- Say the Number that appears followed by "OK" 
- Say "Stop Listening" when you are done to disable the tool

####Expected result:
In both cases, each Text Channel that gets flagged up should only have one Number and Button assigned in the results
####Actual result:
Each Text Channel has at least two buttons that get flagged up on top of each other
