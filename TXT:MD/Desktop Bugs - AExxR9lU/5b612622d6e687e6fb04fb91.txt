####Steps to reproduce:
- Login on the main Discord website 
- go to the HypeSquad homepage

####Expected result:
Since you are already Logged In, the "Apply Now" button should instantly show "Apply Now" rather than "Login"
####Actual result:
The "Apply Now" button starts off showing "Login" and then quickly flips to Apply Now
