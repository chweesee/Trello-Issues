Reported by Marin#9372

####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a large message (large enough so that you can scroll once through the channel and stay hovered over that message) 
- Use the mouse wheel to scroll up or down (stay over the message) AND move your mouse at the same time

####Expected result:
The message, as it's still hovered over, should not lose its "hovered over" background (and thus also the "..." button)
####Actual result:
The "hover" background/... button is gone until you move your mouse again, or it reappears after a second.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 59223 (3569d4e)
####System settings:
Windows 10 x64 (10.0.17134)
