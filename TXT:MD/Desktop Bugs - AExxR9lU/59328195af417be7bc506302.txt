### Somewhat different repro steps:

- Open image sending feature 
- Drag an image down to Discord 
- Send the image after it pulls up the popup 
- Go back to the image selection window and hit cancel - Sam on 2017-07-22T00:58:09.827Z

### Can reproduce, but it's not 100%. Seems to only happen after you've been using Discord normally for a while. After it crashes initially you won't be able to recreate it again for a while. - Jared on 2017-07-31T22:57:08.980Z

### I can no longer reproduce, Discord doesn't crash after uploading the file as described in the repro steps. (I had been using Discord to test bugs for a while when I tried reproducing this one)
