####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to the activity tab. 
- Click on any game title. It should pop up the game info with "recently played" and "now playing" screen. 
- Click on the profile pic of your friend at least 3 times. 
- Click somewhere outside of the game info so the game info closes.

####Expected result:
Game info closes when you click outside.
####Actual result:
Game info never closes, forcing you to restart Discord to get rid of it.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 25069
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro, x64 (v1803)
