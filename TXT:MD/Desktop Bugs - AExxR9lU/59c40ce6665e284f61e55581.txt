####Steps to reproduce:
- Ensure you are on Canary Web _or_ Desktop Canary **without** Spotify installed locally 
- Post a Spotify media link (e.g. /track/) 
- Play the track preview from the embedded player 
- Scroll so the player is no longer in focus (can be up or down)

####Expected result:
The player should continue to play until the message is no longer loaded, as is the case with YouTube videos and such
####Actual result:
The player stops immediately after leaving the visible portion of the screen
####Client settings:
Canary Web (Build 4585) - Chrome Stable 60.0.3112.113 x64
####System settings:
Win 10 Pro x64 v1607

### By design. Intended to only play correctly if spotify is on the computer. this is to avoid performance issues with the way the embed works. - Stanislav Vishnevskiy on 2017-10-09T23:15:55.098Z
