####Steps to reproduce:
- Open a game with overlay enabled 
- Open the overlay and 
- Switch from one conversation to one with a smaller window (a conversation with only a few or even no messages) 
- Observe the drag-to-resize icon

####Expected result:
The resize icon should move along with the overlay if it gets smaller
####Actual result:
The resize icon stays in its original place and appears outside of the conversation box
