- Click Stop Recording 
- ESC to a server voice channel

####Expected result:
Ctrl+Scr LK is set as your keybind and you are able to speak in the voice channel using that keybind.

### Can't reproduce.
I can bind Ctrl + Scroll Lock to PTT and use it to PTT. It does light up and my voice went through.
