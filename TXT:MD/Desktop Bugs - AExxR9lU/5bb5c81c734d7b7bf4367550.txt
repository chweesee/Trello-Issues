####Steps to reproduce:
- Give a user a role and must be a coloured role 
- Highlight/hold down left click and select a user with a role 
- Move your mouse away from the highlighted member 
- Move your mouse over the name and observe it's a role colour of the server member and not highlighted blue (or grey if you click on another page)

####Expected result:
The underline should be the same color or white as the rest of the name
####Actual result:
The underline is the colour of the role before highlighted
