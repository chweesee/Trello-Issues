####Steps to reproduce:
- Write a long channel description and mention a channel or role in it 
- Resize your client/edit the length of the message so it gets cut off, with the "..." indicating that there is more content 
- Have the mention be just after the ... and hover over the "..." or directly behind them

####Expected result:
Areas should not be highlightable if the mention is not visible
####Actual result:
Some areas are highlighted, see attachments
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 23321
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro x64
