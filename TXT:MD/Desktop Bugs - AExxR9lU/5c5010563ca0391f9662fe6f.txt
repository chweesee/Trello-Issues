####Steps to reproduce:
- Connect Wired Xbox 360 controller to the computer 
- Open up 'Edit Bindings' configuration screen 
- Add new keybind for Push To Talk 
- Edit keybind and press on the Xbox Guide/Home Button in the middle of the controller

####Expected result:
The Guide/Home button would be bound to the specific keybind rule.
####Actual result:
Nothing happens. Like the key hasn't been pressed. Other Gamepad keys work though.
