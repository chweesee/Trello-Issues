[Archived] [Resubmission] Clicking the magnifying glass icon on the search bar (the one in the top right, not the server discovery search) will not select/focus the search bar. This is NOT an extension of the un-focus report currently on Trello as that report refers to entirely separate behavior with an entirely separate part of discord, and fixing one will not fix the other. Additionally, div DraftEditor-root will expand to fill the search bar when the magnifying glass is moved elsewhere, indicating it is likely not intended (though I could be wrong).

P3: Will get fixed eventually,
