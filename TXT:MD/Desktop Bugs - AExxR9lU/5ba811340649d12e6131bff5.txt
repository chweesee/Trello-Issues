####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to your User Settings 
- Have 2FA enabled 
- Click "View Backup Codes" & enter your password 
- Move the mouse over a backup code & move the mouse slowly to just below a code

####Expected result:
The cursor should change from a text selection cursor to the regular mouse pointer
####Actual result:
The mouse cursor changes to a closed hand with extended finger as though you were hovering over a hyperlink but moving further away from the backup code takes it back to a regular pointer
