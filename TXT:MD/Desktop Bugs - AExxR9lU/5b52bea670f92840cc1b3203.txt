Reported by Ene#0808

####Steps to reproduce:
- Make a mentionable role (give it a colour so that it's noticeable) and give yourself the role 
- Mention the role in chat and observe the surrounding of the mention's text

####Expected result:
The colour effect surrounding the mention's text should not be present, as it should only appear on role mentions that do not highlight for you
####Actual result:
There is a colour effect around the mention's text even though the mention highlights for you
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.211, Build 19429
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home 64-bit (v1709)
