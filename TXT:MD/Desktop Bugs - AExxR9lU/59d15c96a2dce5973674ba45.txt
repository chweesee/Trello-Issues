Reported by dsf190#5214

####Steps to reproduce:
- Be in a non-AFK voice channel 
- Have an admin move you to an AFK channel.  If you haven't disabled the popup, it should tell you that you are AFK. 
- Have an admin move you back to any voice channel.  For a split second, the text on the popup box will change to "suppressed" and tell you that you don't have permission to speak.

####Expected result:
The popup text should stay the same and close.
####Actual result:
The text changes to "suppressed" and closes.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary Build 5085
####System settings:
Win 10 x64
