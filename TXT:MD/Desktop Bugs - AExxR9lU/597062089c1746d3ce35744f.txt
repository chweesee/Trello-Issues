Reported by Super from NotDiscord™#5419

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open a popup modal.  The easiest way to do that is to either upload a file, or hit Ctrl-/ to bring up the Keyboard Combos menu. 
- Press Ctrl-F.

####Expected result:
The current modal reads the input, and does nothing with it.
####Actual result:
The input is granted to the search bar, allowing you to use it like normal.
####Client settings:
Discord Stable 0.0.297
####System settings:
Windows 7 Professional x64
