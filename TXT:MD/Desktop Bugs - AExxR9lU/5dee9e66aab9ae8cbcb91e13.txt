### An extension of this issue is that if you edit the message, the (edited) message does not wrap correctly. This is reproducible on desktop canary, so I am assuming this is reproducible pretty much on all desktop/browser platforms. You'll need to follow the steps to reproduce in this report then try editing where it is near the end of the line. GIF: https://gyazo.com/3d0c68f5780d83e6610068e1c867a529
