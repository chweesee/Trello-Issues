####Steps to reproduce:
- Open any movie (e.g. YouTube) in fullscreen 
- Hover your mouse cursor near the very top of the Mac screen 
- Observe the buttons for the windows bar there

####Expected result:
You should see some buttons (greyed out or with a function for leaving fullscreen and closing).
####Actual result:
There are no buttons, just a blank grey window bar.
