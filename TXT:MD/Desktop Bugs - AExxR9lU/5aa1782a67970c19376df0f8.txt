Reported by XCVII#4244

####Steps to reproduce:
- Search for something. 
- Go close to the X button so that the cursor is near it but it hasn't changed colour to indicate that it's hovering over it. 
- Left click.

####Expected result:
It should place a cursor in the search bar and let you edit your search query, do nothing or change the colour of the X button to indicate clicking there would cancel the search.
####Actual result:
It closes the search menu with no visual indicators that it will.
####Client settings:
Desktop Canary Build 11585.
####System settings:
macOS 10.13.2
