### Can reproduce again as of Web Canary Build 39493 with Safari Version 12.1.1 and MacBook Pro 13" (2016) running macOS Mojave 10.14.5.

The app now only crashes when removing all characters as mentioned below, edited the ticket to include that.

### I'm unable to reproduce in any browser, neither in Canary (build 39833) or Stable (build 39827) builds of Discord on a Mac. Tested both long and short messages, and clearing via backspace, ctrl+x, and command+backspace. Best guess is this was also fixed with the fix for Reactions in Firefox.
