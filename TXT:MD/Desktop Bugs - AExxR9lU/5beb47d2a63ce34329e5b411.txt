### I seem to be mostly unable to reproduce this bug anymore as of Discord Canary Build 27991. The most that I could reproduce was the tooltip getting stuck, but changing as I move the server around as shown here: https://imgur.com/viy9v0Z

I think this may be an interest, @jfurrow.  - Ghoul on 2018-11-14T23:48:58.771Z
