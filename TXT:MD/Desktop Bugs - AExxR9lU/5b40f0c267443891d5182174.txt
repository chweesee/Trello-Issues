[Archived] When watching an embedded .MP4 file fullscreen, if you watch long enough for the control bar to go away then you pause video by clicking on it, you won't be able to see cursor anymore. So if you want to minimize from full screen you have to start video again for cursor to come back. (https://trello.com/c/OMHNcv4Y)

P3: Will get fixed eventually
