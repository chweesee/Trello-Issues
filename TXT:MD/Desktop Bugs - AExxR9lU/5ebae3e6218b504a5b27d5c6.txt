####Steps to reproduce:
- Open the server settings of a public server in which you have "Manage Server" permission and navigate to "Welcome Screen" 
- Create a new recommended channel or edit an existing one, and open the emoji picker 
- Look at the categories/servers on the left side, and click on different ones and notice where the picker moves to

####Expected result:
Only Frequently Used, the current server, and the standard emojis should be shown as categories on the side
####Actual result:
All servers are shown as normal, however the first several "servers" navigate the picker to standard emoji categories because they don't represent actual categories, while further servers/categories do nothing
####Client settings:
Host 0.0.264, Canary 59984 (f3380b6)
####System settings:
Dell Precision 5520: Windows 10 64-Bit (10.0.18363)
