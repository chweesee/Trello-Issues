New reports of the app crashing as of January 12th 2017



- @discordapp Since a couple of days Discord keeps crashing for me Worked OK before. Can you please do your magic and fix it?

- Discord become unresponsive and then crash. This has been happening every time since the last patch of Discord. I have no idea why this is, but I want to bring it so you can hopefully fix it.

- @discordapp issue with discord it freezes suddenly and cant do anything with it or close it.task manager shows that its stil running though

- @discordapp I'm still having problems with discord, every time I get a dm it stops responding.

- @discordapp Yikes, Discord has been freezing at random (and not recovering after) since the latest patch. Any idea what's up?

- @discordapp Any information on recent bugs causing discord to freeze completely and need to be force closed through task manager?

### My current working theory is this has something to do with being on voice for a long time. - Jared on 2017-01-20T20:10:02.840Z


### I have some info related to this from a couple users!

1\. https://respond2.buffer.com/conversations/8sCtra7PYQyefJY54
Started happening May 10th.
Windows 1607, build 14393.1066
My laptop has 16gb of RAM and an i7-6700HQ processor.
"It seems like it's definitely the notifications that's making it freeze up, because when I get the new message beep I can click on Discord and it will lock up, until the desktop notification pops up; then everything works somewhat normally."

Disabling desktop notifications stops the freezing from happening.

8 GB RAM
Windows 10
It's actually not your fault OR your end nor is it mine...it's a conflict with windows's "desktop notifications." basically if a desktop notification (DN) appeared it would be fine...however if you received multiple DNs in rapid succession, this is what causes the "freeze" issue that's going about. Luckily your application has an option to disable "desktop notifications." After doing so I had a friend spam and I didn't crash when before, I did."

### Sometimes happens randomly on Mac, when ending a screenshare, then the app suddenly freezes, also might crash the app right after.
