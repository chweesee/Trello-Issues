### Tarek asked me to check this bug, so I went ahead and checked it since I had a card that followed this bug's instructions and was able to reproduce previously in January on Discord Canary Build 9280.

I can no longer reproduce as of Discord Canary Build 18720 on Windows 10 Home x64 (1803). I can now see four digital numbers in my card information unlike in the past where I could only see three of them. So I am moving it to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-13T00:21:31.123Z
