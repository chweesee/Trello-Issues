### I'm trying to figure out the best way to fix this issue. If you could see your game in the list and removed it when it was the game you're currently playing, what would you expect to happen in the "currently playing" area? Should we pretend you're not playing a game right now? Should it remain unchanged to show that you're still playing the game? - Joey Baker on 2018-12-12T23:39:45.046Z

### This is not a bug, it's intended that your current game isn't in your game list. If there's enough demand from the community for removing your current game or whatever, we can revisit this.  - Jixuan Wang on 2019-01-29T21:14:26.771Z
