Reported by Ene#0808

####Steps to reproduce:
- Upload an image (I'd try with a largely sized one so it takes longer) 
- Observe the loading background colour of the image as it's being loaded

####Expected result:
Image loading background is grey as before so that it blends into the client
####Actual result:
Image loading background is much too dark, looking quite strange as you're watching images load into your client
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.211, Build 17012
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home 64-bit (v1709)
