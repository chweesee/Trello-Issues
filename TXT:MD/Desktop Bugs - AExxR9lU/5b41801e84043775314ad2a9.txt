####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a random server (such as DTesters). 
- Click on anyone on the members list. 
- Hover over the status bubble so you can see the "hint" ("Do Not Disturb", "Idle", "Online" etc). 
- Observe the profile picture.

####Expected result:
It should only display the "hint" on what the status bubble is currently.
####Actual result:
It displays both the "hint" on what the status bubble is and on the profile picture it displays "View Profile", In fact you can even click on the status bubble and it'll open their profile.
