####Steps to reproduce:
- Find your friend called Bob. 
- Open a group DM first or find an existing DM without Bob. 
- Ask Bob to unfriend you. 
- Type Bob's tag into DM invite box.

####Expected result:
Bob should not be found as he's no longer a friend of you. -
####Actual result:
Bob can still be searched and selected. On clicking "add members" Bob is not added, however. Nothing happens.
