Reported by noobzy#0227

####Steps to reproduce:
- Program a multi-line text macro in MacroWorks 3.1 for Xkeys 60 or 128 using text/emoji combo 
- Try to use the macro in the Discord Stable or PTB/Beta to post by hitting one of the macroed keys

####Expected result:
You can see all of the multiple lines of emojis and text.
####Actual result:
Every successive line is missing something at the beginning of the line as if something kept part of it from posting.
####Client settings:
Discord Stable 0.0.301 / Discord PTB 0.0.43
####System settings:
Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit Service Pack 3
