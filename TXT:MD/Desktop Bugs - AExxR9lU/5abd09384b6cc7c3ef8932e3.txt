####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a bot on the discord bot api page 
- Click on the bot user and move your cursor to the wumpus. 
- A little message should pop up saying 'I'm new to discord, say hi!'.

####Expected result:
No 'I'm new to discord, say hi' on bot users because you can't say hi to a bot ðŸ˜‰
####Actual result:
Bot users have a 'I'm new to discord, say hi' thing on their server 'mini profile' only intended for users.
