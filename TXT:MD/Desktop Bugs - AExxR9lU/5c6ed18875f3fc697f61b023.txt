####Steps to reproduce:
- Open up Discord (Stable or Canary) in your web browser, you need to be running the official Google Chrome OS operating system, tested in Chrome 69/71/72. 
- Make sure you haven't enabled 2FA for the account you've signed in to. Open up the User Settings, and press and hold down the art asset – and try to drag it somewhere. 
- Now test any other art assets found in the different tabs of the User Settings.

####Expected result:
You're supposed to be able to drag all art assets in the User Settings, not just the 2FA-one.
####Actual result:
You're only able to drag the 2FA chest art asset, but no others.
####Client settings:
