####Steps to reproduce:
- Open the server context menu (the menu where you can leave the server) 
- Grant user a permission that adds an option to the server context menu like manage server 
- The new option overwrites an old option 
- If you revert those changes, it goes back to normal 
- On the other hand, if you remove a permission that adds an option to the server context menu while that person's server context menu is open, the extra space for that option doesn't get removed

####Expected result:
The server context menu adjusts option space properly
####Actual result:
If you add an option, that new option overwrites an existing one and if you remove an option, that space stays there
####Client settings:
