### Can reproduce.

I had to change my screen resolution to 1366 x 768 and disable my NVIDIA settings to force my laptop to use my integrated graphics.

### I'm not convinced this is an issue with Discord. It sounds more likely that it's an issue with the Intel HD graphics control panel. - Jared on 2018-06-08T23:07:47.491Z
