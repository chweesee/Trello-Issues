Reported by Mauve Ode Iffier#6602

####Steps to reproduce:
- Send a very long message. The more lines it occupies, the better. 
- Edit the message.

####Expected result:
Typing bar is placed right after the last character.
####Actual result:
Typing bar appears to be placed far away from the last character. When something is typed or after one flash, it jumps back to correct position.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 31784, Safari 11.1.2 (11605.3.8.1)
####System settings:
OS X El Capitan 10.11.6
