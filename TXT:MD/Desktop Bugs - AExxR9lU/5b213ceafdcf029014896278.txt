Reported by Costpap#2158

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a slow internet connection, or send way too many messages, so you've got enough time until they send (like spam "a" over and over, which is what I did in this case) 
- Right click it before it gets fully white, and sends 
- Try and use a feature other than Copy ID while it's still pending, the right click menu will close once it's fully sent 
- Observe that while you can still use them, they still don't apply (for instance, adding an reaction will only add it for less than a second, or editing & attempting to delete via editing won't edit it or delete it)

####Expected result:
You shouldn't be able to right click, or just be able to use them, instead of being able to use it without it applying
####Actual result:
You can "use" them, however, they do not apply.
####Client settings:
Canary; Build 16868
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro x64; 1803.
