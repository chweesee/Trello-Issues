####Steps to reproduce:
- Type a message 
- Send the message 
- Edit the contents so it has more than 2000 characters 
- Press enter or click save 
- Press enter again

The warning closes and it lets you edit again like it does when sending a message(instead of editing)
####Actual result:
The warning doesn't close, but instead a new one is brought up, and you can still type while having the warning on your screen

### I checked this ticket during the Trello cleanup Event since someone commented that it was a duplication of the ticket above (which ALSO happens to be a duplication of https://trello.com/c/0YojyjSA/853-pressing-enter-on-modals-does-not-close-them-like-it-used-to )

I do agree that they are all a duplication as they have the same end result with same reproduction steps. So I will be archiving this. - Ghoul on 2018-07-06T04:27:59.057Z
