Reported by JohnyTheCarrot#0368

####Steps to reproduce:
- Fullscreen discord 
- Open the help menu 
- Resize Discord to it's minimum height and see how the search bar is half hidden behind the other UI elements.

####Expected result:
It should scale along with the white panel instead of going behind it.
####Actual result:
It half hides behind the white menu.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 4120 0.0.163
