Reported by Namjies#2994

####Steps to reproduce:
- Set a server with nickname permission disabled for all roles 
- Add a user to observe server 
- Add a user with the username RandomNick and nickname ThemedNick to server 
- Have the user change his username to ThemedNick. 
- Have the user change his username to BadWord. 
- From observer account, observe that user who changed their username to BadWord now appear as BadWord in the online list.

####Expected result:
For users with a nickname set to keep being shown as that user.
####Actual result:
User will be shown as their new username for everyone on the server, until people reload/refresh, at which point user will be shown again with their actual enforced nickname. Since users can change username twice per hour, they could constantly update it to keep appearing under a different nickname for everyone else online.
####Client settings:

### This is not a bug. This is the desired functionality. If you have the ability to change your nickname, you can change your nickname. If you change your username, the nickname no longer applies. - Jared on 2017-08-21T19:52:09.713Z
