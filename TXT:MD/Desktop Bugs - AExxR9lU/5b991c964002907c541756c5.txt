Reported by Rage#9991

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Discord on Firefox 
- Go to user settings 
- Go to Voice & Video 
- Click "access to your microphone" under the input sensitivity bar 
- Observe where the arrow is pointing

####Expected result:
The arrow points at "Allow", like it does on Windows, on Windows the buttons are the other way around, so an exception should be created for Mac
####Actual result:
The arrow points at "Don't Allow"
####Client settings:
Canary 23506
####System settings:
Firefox 62.0, macOS Sierra 10.12.6
