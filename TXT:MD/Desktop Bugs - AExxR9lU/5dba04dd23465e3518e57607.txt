####Steps to reproduce:
- Open the Library tab 
- Right click any game 
- Look for "Show on activity feed"

####Expected result:
Only one should appear, and they should not do the same action
####Actual result:
If I were to click one of the two "Show on Activity Feed" checkboxes, it will toggle both.
