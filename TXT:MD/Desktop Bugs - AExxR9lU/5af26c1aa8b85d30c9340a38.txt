### A quick note on this: This only happens to channels that have permissions set up only to deny "View Channel" as so: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/443610002822004757/443610761307226114/unknown.png

Having "Connect" also on deny in the above situation stops this from being possible through the quickswitcher. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2018-05-09T03:35:40.552Z


### Can reproduce.
64 Bit Windows 10 Home (V1709) ptb, Build Number: 14712.
