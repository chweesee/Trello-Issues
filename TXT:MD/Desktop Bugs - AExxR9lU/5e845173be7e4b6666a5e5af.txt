**Short Description:** Unable to create, or cancel, or X out of server template screen on 200% zoom
**Steps to reproduce:** 
- Click to view server template
- Set zoom level to 200%
- Attempt to hit enter to create, or attempt to scroll up and down for the physical buttons to cancel or create server

**Expected Results:** You should be able to scroll all the way up or down to access these options
**Actual Results:** It does not scroll all the way to the edge so you are left with only exiting out of the screen with Esc
