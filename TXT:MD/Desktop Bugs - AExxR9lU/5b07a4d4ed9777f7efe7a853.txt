Reported by Ene#0808

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have permission to access the Members section in a server and open it 
- Find a user with enough roles to give the Role UI option 
- Open the Role UI modal and observe the top left

####Expected result:
Role overflow arrow placed correctly where it belongs (no idea where it belongs as it has never been correctly placed, but I assume outside of the modal)
####Actual result:
Role overflow arrow is placed strangely inside of the Role UI modal
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.210, Build 16078
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home 64-bit (v1709)
