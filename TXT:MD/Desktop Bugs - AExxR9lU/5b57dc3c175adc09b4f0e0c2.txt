[Archived] If you get mentioned in a private channel, then lose access before you read the ping. It will be forever stuck in quick switcher and marking the server as read doesn't fix it either (Try several times, took a few times to repro for me, and after a while the ping notification would come back and be stuck) (https://trello.com/c/wOY0eoMr)

P3: Will get fixed eventually,

####Steps to reproduce:
- Get access to a private channel 
- Restart or reload your client completely 
- Get mentioned 
- Ask for your access to be revoked to the channel (make sure the everyone role doesn't have read message history and read message permission)  
- Observe the stuck ping notification in quick switcher

####Expected result:
It should not show the channel as unread ping in quick switcher if you don't have read access.
####Actual result:
You have a stuck ping in quick switcher, and doesn't clear when you mark the server as read
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.211 (19322)
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (1803)
