### **Extension to this issue**
If your embed title has any link, the copy link for the thumbnail will show the title link in that case.

### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 home x64 v.1809 - Canary 33117. also, it doesn't copy an invalid ID for me, it copies the jump link to the last channel/message you navigated to. so for example by jumping to a message through search and scrolling down and doing the same steps with an embed, it will copy the jump link of the message you jumped to.
