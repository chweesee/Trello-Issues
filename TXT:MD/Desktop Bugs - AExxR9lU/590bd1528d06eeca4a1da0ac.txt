### Are you sure @tarek1337 ? Can you try again? Works for me. - Shadi Isber on 2018-05-21T20:31:10.886Z


### @shadiisber I just tested this with every language..
It appears to be work for some, but the ones that breaks are: German, French, Croatian, Italian, Lithuanian, Hungarian, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Finnish, Turkish, Czech, Greek, Bulgarian, Russian, Ukranian, Chinese China, Japanese, Chinese Taiwan, Korean.

I tested this on Discord Canary 0.0.209 (15733) on Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (1803) on the desktop app, not canary web. A couple of other bug hunters can also reproduce this, And if it even matters. I have Swedish system language. - Tarek on 2018-05-22T03:14:04.512Z


### @kamillakarthigesu1 Mind taking a look at this again when you get a chance? - Shadi Isber on 2018-05-22T03:19:26.764Z
