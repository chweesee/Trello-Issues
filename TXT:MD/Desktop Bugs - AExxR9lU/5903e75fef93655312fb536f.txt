### This just seems like it's the same as when a user is given the "Manage Permissions" permission, but not "Manage Channel", which means they can't actually manage the permissions at all. If this particular issue is considered a bug (ie with audit logs), theoretically, that means the issue I described is also a bug, no?

### Moved from Audit Log Bugs to Claimed Fixed, needs Verification by Michael Peterson on 2017-05-02T22:43:51.128Z


### Tested as of latest canary:

I can no longer reproduce this. Giving a role only "View Audit Logs" shows up three options though:

Overview (normal), Audit Logs (fixed) but also Members.

I'm not sure if the last part (Members) is intended, but I did not give the rank anything else except for view audit logs. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-05-02T23:30:21.547Z
