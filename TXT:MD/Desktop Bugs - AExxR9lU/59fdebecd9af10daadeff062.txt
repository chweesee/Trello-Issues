### The steps are a bit wrong well harder then they need to be, one can reliably do this by editing a message then typing anything then press shift and esc to quit editing, then go back to editing that message and it'll happen. <https://i.imgur.com/v5bfj79.gifv>

### Faster and easier repro step is to have a channel mention on the end of the message, edit the message and the channel mention list will pop-up, pick the channel again.

### I checked this bug during the Trello cleanup event, and I was not able to reproduce on Discord Canary Build 18317 on Windows 10 Home x64 (1803). I have tried several times to get the bug to happen (tried different keys) but they are working as intended. 

Because of this, I'm gonna call this a Claimed Fixed and move it there. - Ghoul on 2018-07-08T05:26:50.106Z
