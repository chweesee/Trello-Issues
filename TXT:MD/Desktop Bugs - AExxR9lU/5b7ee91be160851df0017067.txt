Reported by Andre_601#0601

####Steps to reproduce:
- Scroll to the bottom of the voice and textchannel 
- switch to DMs (Either by directly clicking on the indicator or by just clicking on home) 
- go back to the guild

####Expected result:
You should still be at the bottom of the channels (or at least at the position of the selected one)
####Actual result:
Discord scrolled to the top of the voice and textchannels, even if you have a textchannel at the bottom selected
####Client settings:
