[Archived] Canary, Guest Mode, the art that looks like a knight, a person, a bear, and a wizard, is draggable, it shouldn't be. (https://trello.com/c/gG05y2PY)

Reported by Casper#9999

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to e.g. Fortnite in Canary Guest Mode using links in desktop-announcements 
- Look at the art asset I described in the floating footer saying "Sign up for Discord", try to drag it with your mouse 
- Press the "Login" button, and try to drag a smaller version of this art asset in the newly opened modal with your mouse 
- Press the "Register" button and do the same as the step above

####Expected result:
This art asset should not be draggable, the same art is used in the "claim your account"-modal, and it's not draggable.
####Actual result:
You can drag this art asset with your mouse.
