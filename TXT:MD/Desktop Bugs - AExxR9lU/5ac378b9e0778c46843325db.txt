####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a server with multiple people. 
- Have Friend A to change their username to be on top of the server list or the bottom of the server list. 
- Observe your server member list.

####Expected result:
Friend A automatically gets moved to the new position.
####Actual result:
Friend A stays in the original position. 
For example, b1nzy stayed under AndyG when he changed his username to Wolfiri for Aprilâ€™s Fools instead of going under Voltana.
