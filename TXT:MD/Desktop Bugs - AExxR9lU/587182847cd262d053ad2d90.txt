Reported by Aaron#7079

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Create a embed that contains user mentions 
- Right click user mentions 

####Expected result:
 Context menu should contain all the normal options for a context menu on a message, as well as the options for right clicking a guild member. 
####Actual result:
 On windows, no context menu is shown. On mac, Context menu only shows results for Search with Google, and Copy (Not copy ID)
