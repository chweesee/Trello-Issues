####Steps to reproduce:
- 
Step 1: Navigate to a Playlist that does not have imported songs and play a song. <:greenTick:312314752711786497> Spotify status should display.
Step 2: Now navigate to a playlist that has a mix of imported and non imported songs.
Step 3: Play a imported song. Either the Discord status will show the old non imported song playing, or will not show the status. 
Step 4: Play a non imported song in the same playlist. <:redTick:312314733816709120> Spotify status does not display. 
Additionally, Navigating to another playlist that ONLY has non imported songs will cause that status to show.

####Expected result:
Spotify Status message should display for any non imported song regardless if the playlist is purely non imported or has a mixture of imported and non imported songs.
####Actual result:
Sprotify Status will not show unless a user navigates to another playlist containing only non imported songs.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary Build 10189
####System settings:
