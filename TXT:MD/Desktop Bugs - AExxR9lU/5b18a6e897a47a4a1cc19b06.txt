####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure you installed more than one (or two) microphone devices (not sure if virtual device counts) 
- Go to User Settings > Voice & Video > use Voice Activity 
- Still in same settings, go to Audio subsystem and select experimental, press okay and let Discord do its reload (if its already in experimental, do reload manually by pressing Ctrl + R) 
- Go to User Settings > Voice & Video and switch microphone devices a few times

####Expected result:
Discord changes the setting successfully without crash
####Actual result:
Discord crash and restarts (but that new settings is applied successfully)
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 16581
####System settings:
Windows 10 1803 x64
