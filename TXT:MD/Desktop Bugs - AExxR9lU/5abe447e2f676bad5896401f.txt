### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Pro 1709 x64, Canary Build 12929; For me this bug first occured after I restarted discord in compact mode. As long as I never started it in compact mode, I was able to switch between modes without having this bug. But after starting it in compact mode, I am not able to get the tag back; In the Stable Build it's all fine for me tho
