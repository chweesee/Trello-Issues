### Can reproduce.
The extension listed in this report is still reproducible (1 character name). In addition to this, editing the title to a blank space per the steps to reproduce creates a bad request (which was probably the fix) but the user becomes trapped in the server template menu as the "Save Changes" pop-up does not dismiss until they hit reset.
