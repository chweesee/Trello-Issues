####Steps to reproduce:
- Be able to send animated emojis 
- Go to a server where you can scroll channels 
- Send animated emojis 
- Scroll the channels list, or point mouse to a channel name and try to scroll

####Actual result:
The animated emojis lags and sometimes stop until you don't scroll anymore

### Verified, extremely low priority. I don't know if this is _actually_ a bug or not, will ask. - Jared on 2018-01-16T21:56:00.995Z


### According to one of our engineers, this is not a valid bug, just performance with animated emoji, which are inherently resource heavy. - Jared on 2018-01-19T19:40:46.737Z
