None

Reported by ChaseTug13#1213

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open a game 
- Enable overlay 
- Make sure game is detected by discord 
- Enable overlay for that game 
- Go to game and open overlay 
- Drag server list to bottom-left corner 
- Click Settings 
- Observe (only happens with shorter monitors, mine is 1360x768)

####Expected result:
The settings page should show up directly next to the server list (its shorter than the server list so it should fit)
####Actual result:
The settings page appears above the server list and gets cutoff, when it could fit beside the list
####Client settings:
Desktop Canary, Version 18749
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home (64-Bit), Version 1803
