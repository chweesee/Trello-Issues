####Steps to reproduce:
- Open a packet monitor such as Wireshark. 
- Join a voice channel. 
- Ensure no green ring appears around your profile in the voice channel's member list. This can be by not talking loud enough or by muting yourself. 
- Observe in the packet monitor that voice data is still transmitted.

####Expected result:
No data, other than the expected keep alive packets, should be transmitted to the relay server when not talking or muted.
####Actual result:
Voice data is continuously transmitted, even if physically muted, muted in Discord itself, or speaking below the sensitivity volume.
####Client settings:

### Is this browser or desktop client? - Jozsef Vass on 2019-07-29T19:52:56.205Z


### This is the normal behavior for browser client. We do send speaking indication over websocket to voice server and server only forwards audio when speaking. For Desktop client, we do not send audio when not speaking. Could you please confirm this behavior. - Jozsef Vass on 2019-07-29T20:58:54.752Z
