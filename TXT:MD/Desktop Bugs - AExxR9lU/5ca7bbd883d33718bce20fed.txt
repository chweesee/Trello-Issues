[Archived] Big memory leakage while using Screenshare (https://trello.com/c/Xbl1udTq)

P1: Severe

Created: 2019-04-05T20:34:33.031Z
Latest Update: 2019-06-13T09:00:41.876Z

Reported by Harutato üíô#6660

####Steps to reproduce:

- Go into a call 
- Screenshare a Chrome/Firefox window (preferably while a video is playing, that's how I was able to reproduce best. Might also be reproducable with other programs but these 2 were confirmed to be reproducable)  
- Keep an eye on your RAM usage in Task Manager

####Expected result:
RAM usage should be normal between 300-400mb like on Discord Stable
####Actual result:
RAM usage drastically increasing at an alarming rate (I got upto 3gb RAM usage after just a few minutes)
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 35116
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64 v1809

### Can reproduce on Discord Canary Build 35116 on Windows 10 Home x64 (1809) with Mozilla FireFox playing a YouTube video in almost full-screen. Even after that I've ended the video call, the memory will still continue to leak. I've bumped into 2GB of RAM being used after this test.

Verifying this as a P1 bug, and moving to Notable Issues.  - Ghoul on 2019-04-05T20:41:44.431Z
