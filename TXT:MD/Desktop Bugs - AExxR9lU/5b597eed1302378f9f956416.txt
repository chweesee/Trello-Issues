####Steps to reproduce:
- Ensure you're on cozy mode 
- Do anything that will trigger a clyde message (Change your nickname through /nick, DM a user who blocked you, etc.) 
- Keep the message visible and send a message after the clyde message

####Expected result:
There is a large gap between the two messages
####Actual result:
Clyde messages flow with the rest of the chat messages
