####Steps to reproduce:
- First, notice how many members you have in your server by going to server settings > members. 
- Then, prune some members. 
- After pruning, notice how many people are in your server now.

####Expected result:
The amount of members after pruning should differentiate between how many you had originally by how many you have pruned.
####Actual result:
New member count doesn't update until you restart Discord.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 27841
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro, x64 (v1803)
