[Archived] Option tooltips get stuck if you hover over the options as you're entering a Settings page (Server Settings, Channel Settings, User Settings) I find Server Settings > Integrations > Connect > Closing the Connections page and hovering over where the options are the easiest way of reproducing this (https://trello.com/c/TRWtJtiK)

P3: Will get fixed eventually,
Mid

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open a settings page and hover over where the options would be right as it is transitioning into the page

####Expected result:
Tooltips should either vanish instantly or not appear at all when in the process of entering a Settings page
####Actual result:
Tooltips appear and get stuck until you hover over the option that produced the tooltip after exiting the Settings page you were in
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.197, Build 9532
####System settings:

### Can reproduce.
Can also be found this way - Put your Status Indicator on Do Not Disturb (May work with others but didn't test) - Go to a server where you can see yourself on the members list - Type something in chat so you see the typing animation on your member list profile. - Delete what you typed in chat, and quickly hover your cursor all the way to the right, and towards the bottom of the red DnD typing indicator on the members list - When the typing animation goes away, move your cursor to the right, and then away - Watch attached Gif for help. https://i.imgur.com/jvvrpGK.gifv
