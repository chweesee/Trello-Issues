### Pretty sure this is not actually a bug, but intended behavior. If you leave the channel and go somewhere else, the unread indicator will not show next to the channel, it is already considered read since you can see all the messages on screen. The mark as read is also disabled if you right click the channel, which shows that this is how it's always been. - Amadeus on 2017-09-18T07:57:42.122Z

### Archiving as has been listed as NAB for more than a month. - Mike Nisbet on 2017-10-19T20:16:34.639Z

### Note for future bug reports: The NAB status of this card specifically represents the behavior of the "Mark as Read" menu item when you are actively looking at the channel that is receiving new messages, in which case the channel (and thus category) will have the Mark as Read option disabled, since those messages are immediately marked as read when they come in.

Cases where the Mark as Read item is disabled when you are _not_ currently in the channel are separate from this issue, may be a bug, and should not be marked as duplicates of this card. - Jon Egeland on 2020-05-20T17:52:06.471Z
