####Steps to reproduce:
- Link a Mac and an Apple Watch to the same Apple ID 
- In System Preferences on the Mac, go to "Security" and enable "Allow your Apple Watch to unlock your Mac" (if you don't see it, use a different computer) 
- Start a video call and share your screen 
- End the call 
- Lock your screen (there's an option for this under the Apple menu) 
- Wait for the screen to turn off -Press any key to turn the screen on, with the Apple Watch near the computer

####Expected result:
The Mac automatically unlocks, because screen sharing was ended
####Actual result:
The login window says "Unlocking with Apple Watch is not supported while your screen is being shared"
####Client settings:
Canary 33418
####System settings:
