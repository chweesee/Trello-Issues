####Steps to reproduce:
- Create enough roles to scroll 
- Click and hold a role from the top 
- Drag the role to the bottom of the screen until it starts to scroll to the bottom 
- Watch it jump back up over and over when you hit the bottom

####Expected result:
Scolling should go to the bottom and stop
####Actual result:
Scrolling jumps back to the top everytime you hit the bottom
