####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to any server and click on 'View Profile' of any of the users who shares a mutual server with you 
- Navigate to the 'Mutual Servers' tab of their profile 
- Right click on any of the mutual servers and leave that mutual server (Do this just via the user's profile)

####Expected result:
The left server should disappear from the list of mutual servers
####Actual result:
The server remains there on the list (It vanishes after you close their profile and open it again)
