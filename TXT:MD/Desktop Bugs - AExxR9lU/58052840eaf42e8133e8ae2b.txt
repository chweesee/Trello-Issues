### This has been fixed for at least 2 months now. Obviously if you don't format as a real email address, it'll break, but the core purpose of this ticket was to report it for emails, which is fixed. Needs to be moved to Verified Fixed imo

### Will mention if the discrim is invalid, which ties in with the short description
