####Steps to reproduce:
- Create 2 channels 
- Put a channel at the top 
- Revoke "Generate invite links" permission on the top channel 
- Allow "Generate invite links" permission on the second channel 
- Click on the server name then "Invite People"

####Expected result:
It should generate an invite link to the second channel since you have permission to do
####Actual result:
The window will just load forever and you will get "Missing access" errors in the console
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.163 (Build 3571)
