Reported by -Shadow-#9999

####Steps to reproduce:
- Change servers 
- Observe the channel list. If it doesn't happen, try a few more times. It's somewhat inconsistent, but I can reproduce it about 70% of the time. Yes, I have tried restarting Discord. It still happens.

####Expected result:
Channel list switches over to the new server, as expected
####Actual result:
Channel list shows channels the server you were on just before, if you click on the channels they send you to that channel in the previous server.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 39515
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64 Version 10.0.17763 Build 17763

### Can reproduce.
CR, Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview x64 1903; Discord Canary Build 39515. It is best to reproduce this in a server which you haven't cached and takes a long time to load.
