### I can reproduce this bug with the same reproduction steps as of Discord Canary Build 18474 on Windows 10 Home x64 (1803). I no longer see the x button in the search, and it is is missing.

Moving this bug to User Reported Bugs for verification. - Ghoul on 2018-07-10T21:10:01.254Z

### I can no longer reproduce this bug as of Discord Canary Build 18720 on Windows 10 Home x64 (1803). I see the x button when I put something in my search button, so it's back in action and ready to rumble!

Because of this, I am moving it to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-12T23:28:17.213Z
