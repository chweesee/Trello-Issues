**Short Description:** After deleting a template, the link completely breaks for users with it loaded in their client.
**Steps to reproduce:**
- create a template
- Post the template somewhere where another user can see it
- Delete the template
- Have the user attempt to interact in any way with the template link

**Expected Results:** The template link should update like invites do and tell the user that it has expired
**Actual Results:** The modal goes through with creation however when the user attempts to create the server, the template just closes the dialog (but doesn't update to expired)
**Client Settings:** Discord Canary 56739 
**System Settings:** Windows 10 Pro 64-Bit (Build 18362)
