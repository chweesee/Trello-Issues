####Steps to reproduce:
- Enable Streamer Mode. 
- Click/CMD+Tab into another window. 
- Have someone call you. 
- Notice the application bounce. 
- If nothing happens, try full screening the application you navigate to, then repeat the steps.

####Expected result:
The application should not bounce as Streamer Mode behaves the same as DND.
####Actual result:
The application bounces on the dock when receiving the call, unlike what happens in DnD.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.185 (build 9486)
####System settings:
MacBook Pro (late 2013), macOS Sierra 10.12.1

### I feel like this is intentional behavior. Streamer mode is not intended to be analogous to DnD. - Jared on 2018-01-17T00:14:28.950Z
