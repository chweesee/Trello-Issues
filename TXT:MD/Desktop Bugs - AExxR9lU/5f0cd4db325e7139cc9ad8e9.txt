Reported by Jean20B#4668

####Steps to reproduce:
- Start a call in DM 
- Hover over the mute button and look at the tooltip 
- If you expand or fullscreen the call (with a video call or screenshare), the tooltip will go even further and it will be no longer visible 
- If you cannot repro with the zoom set to 100%, zoom in or out and try again

####Expected result:
The tooltip is above the mute button
####Actual result:
The Mute tooltip goes far away
####Client settings:
Canary 63045 host 0.0.266
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64 2004 (10.0.19041)
