Reported by charleskimbac#6492

####Steps to reproduce:
- get a stream to show up under 'now playing' in the activity tab (i think you have to get someone to stream an official game with another person watching) 
- start watching the stream 
- go to the activity tab

####Expected result:
you don't appear in the activity tab, as you don't appear in recently/now playing
####Actual result:
you show up in the activity tab
