####Steps to reproduce: 
- Go into the member list of a server 
- Filter members by role (Check user count before filtering) 
- Compare current user count to the "@ everyone" user count 

####Expected result:
 It should only display the total number of users with the role being filtered 
####Actual result:
 The user count stays as the "@ everyone" user count 
####System settings:
 Ubuntu 16.04 LTS    Latest Canary (Unsure of version #)
