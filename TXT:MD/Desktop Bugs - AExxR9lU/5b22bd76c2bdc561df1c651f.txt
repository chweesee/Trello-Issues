### 1. How long does it take approximately this to happen? 
2. Does it happen on High Sierra?

When you open voice/video settings, we start running audio capture and processing for displaying voice level. - Jozsef Vass on 2018-07-13T15:36:34.557Z


### Can reproduce.
Reproduced on Discord canary, Build Number: 19430 macOS Mojave Beta (18A336e). Leaks slower without going to settings. 1) Open Discord. 2) Leave it for a few hours. 3) Crashes due to memory leak.

### Can reproduce.
Responding to Jozsef Vass; (1) macOS will crash after 1 -> 2 hours depending on amount of RAM. (2) This does not happen on High Sierra. It's very specifically during Voice/Audio capture. When you open the pane, you do not automatically start registering voice/video on macOS until an event occurs to identify microphone usage, this is noted even when running High Sierra however memory jumps no more than a maximum of 200MB from the start of the runtime. Recently repro'd on MacOS 10.14 Mojave (18A336e - MacBook Pro 15-inch, mid-2015 iGPU at 2.2GHz).

### Can't reproduce.
MacOS Mojave 10.14 (dev beta 5+, current: 18A371a) Issue was possibly on Appleâ€™s side, issue cleared after pushing Feedback report to Apple on dev beta 4.
