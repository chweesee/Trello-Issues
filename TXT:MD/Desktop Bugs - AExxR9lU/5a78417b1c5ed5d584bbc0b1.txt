####Steps to reproduce:
- Change your language to something (e.g. French/Spanish) 
- Go into the modal at the end of your server list 
- Enter Create a Server and observe the Change button's text

####Expected result:
Language change properly applies to the "Change" text upon changing
####Actual result:
"Change" text is in your previous language and doesn't change until you refresh
####Client settings:
