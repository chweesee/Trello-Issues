####Steps to reproduce:
- Post gif with small height or any other gif 
- Hover on GIF label (for gif with big height you need to do it fast) 
- You will see this bug (label not dissappear and gif not play and click not work)

####Expected result:
Gif should play and responce on clicks
####Actual result:
You hover on <span class="image-gif"></span> and javascript not work with it. For solving need simple add to CSS rule to ".image .image-gif" selector: "pointer-events: none;" (so hover will work on canvas and you can click through it).
