Reported by Elliott#1468

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to any channel 
- Write `@everyone` into the box (Make sure you have permissions) 
- Press Enter

####Expected result:
It should just send the message, as mentions don't work in blockquotes
####Actual result:
The system warns you as if you were properly doing @everyone.
####Client settings:
Build 16139 (Regular Discord)
####System settings:
Windows 10

### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Home 1803 64-Bit Build 17134.81 [BUILD INFO] Release Channel: stable, Build Number: 16162, Version Hash: 905c666082c26511971c48bdfd2640e44683e187 It looks like putting either the Here and/or Everyone Mentions can trigger this one regardless. In fact whether it's a Code Tag or a Code Block it triggers. Not sure if it's a Bug but I CR the behaviour anyway
