Reported by Solo#0007

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open User Settings > Activity Feed 
- Search something that you know is a result such as "Rainbow" 
- Observe how there are no search results 
- Search the beginning of that same game such as "Tom Clancy" 
- Observe how "Rainbow Six Siege" is shown as a result

####Expected result:
The results should not require you to type in the first part of the game's title.
####Actual result:
Results only display if you typed in the beginning of the game's title.
####Client settings:
Canary 34132
