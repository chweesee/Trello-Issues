####Actual result:
 you are invisible but appear offline even on your screen (no grey online status dot or typing indicator) 
####System settings:

### Can reproduce.
ArchLinux, Discord, I can reproduce with going invisible and it'll immediately show up. This must be in a server small enough where you can see offline members.
