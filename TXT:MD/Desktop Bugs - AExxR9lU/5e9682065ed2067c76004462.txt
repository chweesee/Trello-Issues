Reported by Riley#7898

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a DM that is long enough that it doesn't mark it as read (Make sure that you're not already in the DM) 
- Leave the DM and go to any server (If you go to another DM that you have open you will see the tiny dot) 
- The message icon will now show the long bar like you're still in that DM instead of the tiny dot showing you have an unread message.

####Expected result:
The long line should be the tiny dot showing you have a/an unread message(s)
####Actual result:
Discord still leaves the long line like you're still in the DM, even though you're in a server.
