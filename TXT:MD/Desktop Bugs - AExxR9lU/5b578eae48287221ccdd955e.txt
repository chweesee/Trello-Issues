Reported by ImEmir#6672

####Steps to reproduce:
- Make a video with any supported software. 
- Export it as 50x50 or less pixel [i thought it was 2x2 only thanks to <@363699988628373504> for testing it with different sizes) keep the ratio 1:1) 
- Send it over Discord as mp4, avi, mov or webm to someone that uses desktop client.

####Expected result:
It should either resize the player or not allow to send the file.
####Actual result:
Easy rickrolls and earrapes.
####Client settings:
It can be any Chrome based Discord
####System settings:
(Doesnâ€™t matters) Windows 10 Professional Latest Insider Build Turkish
