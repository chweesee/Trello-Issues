####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure discord is set to minimize to tray when closed, then "close" discord 
- Wait for a notification to come through, then click it.

####Expected result:
Discord should open itself, with focus, and be on the correct message.
####Actual result:
discord does not open or focus itself, the notification just disappears.
