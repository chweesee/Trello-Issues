####Steps to reproduce:change discord language to German 
- click on the search bar and start a search 
- type (von:) which means from to filter by user 
- select a random user then start a search for it to save in history 
- go to language settings and change the language back to English 
- open the search bar and observe 
- (this can be done with other filters/languages if the older language contains filters from the new one just like "von" contains "on")

####Expected result:
search history should stay the same no matter the language you change to
####Actual result:
Discord detects "on" from "von" as a filter and puts a space after the letter v
####Client settings:
