### Can reproduce.
MacBookAir7,1, Happens with any of the same 2 roles according to https://trello.com/c/3J2CSCnC/819-you-can-only-submit-1-mention-from-2-roles-with-same-name. I'd imagine that the global <@&259909937403133953> role overrides the server everyone role. There should be a way to mention both roles, instead of just one of the roles showing up when you mention.

### This makes no sense, we have a verified bug about this in Android but the other way around. So I don't know if this is a NAB or the Android ticket.

Which is this: https://trello.com/c/wJdj3TLV/785-doing-an-everyone-ping-from-mobile-uses-real-everyone-instead-of-custom-role

So this is quite confusing - Tarek on 2018-03-07T06:16:03.491Z


### Possibly dupe/ext of https://trello.com/c/3J2CSCnC/

### I'd argue that this is an extension of https://trello.com/c/wJdj3TLV/785-doing-an-everyone-ping-from-mobile-uses-real-everyone-instead-of-custom-role, since there should be a way to mention either role. Verified.  - Clayton on 2018-03-07T22:18:26.234Z
