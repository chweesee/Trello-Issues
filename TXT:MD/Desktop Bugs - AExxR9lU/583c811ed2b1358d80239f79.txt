Reported by ùÖ≥ùÖ≥#5756

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Join a VoiceChannel (VC) in Guild A 
- Have a bot join the same VC in Guild A 
- Have the bot join a VC in Guild B, a mutually shared Guild 
- Have the bot play audio in the VC of Guild A. Playback could have also have been started before bot joined VC in Guild B 
- Have the bot sever the audio connection to the VC in Guild B (leave, not just switch channels) 

####Expected result:
 no change to the audio playback from the bot in the VC of Guild A 
####Actual result:
 audio playback of the bot is immediately stopped. Leaving and rejoining the VC will fix the issue. [Submitted for DV8FromTheWorld#6297]
