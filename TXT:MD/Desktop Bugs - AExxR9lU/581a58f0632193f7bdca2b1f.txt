### Tested on build 4820:

I can no longer reproduce this myself. It seems that if you have server-wide manage webhooks you can now make webhooks for whatever channel (channel permissions or not) as long as it's selectable from the drop-down option in the webhook menu. No errors or anything. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-09-26T09:43:37.473Z
