### Checked as of latest canary:

This is half fixed. You can no longer chat in a channel that doesn't allow you.

HOWEVER, the plus upload part is still shown for channels you don't have upload access to. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-07-11T00:35:10.044Z


### Checked as of latest canary:

I can no longer reproduce this myself. Channels that don't allow you to chat stop you from doing so. Channels where you don't have attach file permission don't show the upload plus button. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-07-11T11:48:47.745Z
