### You *can* scroll up, but it's janky and shitty.  Definitely a bug. - Jared on 2016-12-09T18:30:45.428Z

### I am unsure if I can reproduce, but something about it still seems off. Instead of smooth scrolling up with the server icon dragging, it just runs up there and it's not really smooth. Used Dell Latitude E5540 with Windows 10 Pro, Fall Creators Update on Discord Canary 0.0.189 (Build 8903)
