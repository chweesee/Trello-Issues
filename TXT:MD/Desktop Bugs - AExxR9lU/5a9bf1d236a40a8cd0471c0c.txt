Reported by Eagler1997#7990

####Steps to reproduce:
- go to your friends list, select any friend, does not matter what position
- use alt + down arrow to scroll down in your friends list 
- keep alt button pressed and use the arrow key to scroll down, some users need to do it fast others slow
- After 10 - 15 Friends this bug happens, the first friends all work fine.
- watch as how the selector goes down and scroll past the boundaries of the visible part of the screen

####Expected result:
The friendlist scrolls down when reaching the last visible person on your friends list
####Actual result:
the selector goes outside of the visible area, and it select a friend that is currently not visible for you
