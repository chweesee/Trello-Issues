####Steps to reproduce:
- Run Discord in windowed mode 
- Prioritize another window and leave the Discord window controls visible 
- Attempt to use Discord's window controls while Discord is not the actively selected program

####Expected result:
Window controls should be actionable even if Discord is not the active window (this is the behavior with other programs--tested and verified with the Safari window controls)
####Actual result:
Window controls are non-functional unless the client is the active window
####Client settings:
Desktop Canary 30441
####System settings:
macOS Mojave 10.14.1
