Reported by Blair#7777

####Steps to reproduce:
- First off, join a voice channel 
- Second, click the icon next to mute and deafen, which will prompt you to set your voice status 
- Type something short like 2-3 words or 5 characters 
- Observe this works 
- Type something that has like 1000 Characters 
- Observe when you click the button it does nothing 
- The characters I used were: HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIHIIIIIIIIIII (This triggered it)

####Expected result:
It should tell you, "You have reached the max amount of characters". Or atleast respond to you when you click the button
####Actual result:
It just stays the same and does nothing.
