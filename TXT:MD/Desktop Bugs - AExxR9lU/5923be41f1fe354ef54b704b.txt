####Steps to reproduce:
- set Chat Font Scaling to a value above 100% 
- send 'hello      goodbye' in chat (several spaces between the two words)

####Expected result:
'hello' and 'goodbye' should have a wide space between them
####Actual result:
'hello' and 'goodbye' are a single space apart, following normal html whitespace collapsing rules.

The CSS, as written, seems to intend this effect, employing "pre-wrap" versus "pre-line" as the white-space value.
However, this seems
1) unexpected to an end user
2) like kind of a punishment to someone's chatting experience just because they want bigger text
3) unclear intention-wise. What I'd expect with bigger text is making sure long lines don't stretch their container, but that's already well enforced.

### Will be fixed in next canary.  Compact still collapses because.. reasons.  Cozy should be ok though. - Shadi Isber on 2017-05-31T22:45:24.147Z


### Checked as of latest canary:

I can no longer reproduce this myself. The whitespace works fine in cozy for me @ 150% font scaling. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-06-01T11:45:36.141Z
