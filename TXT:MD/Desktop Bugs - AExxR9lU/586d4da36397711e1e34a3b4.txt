Reported by WhoCaresAboutThat#2467

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Go to a channel with a name so long that it goes past the top right icons in length 
- Press Ctrl-F 

####Expected result:
 The menu shows up as in a normal server 
####Actual result:
 Everything except for the search textbox and top right icons goes left off the screen forcing you to switch servers to fix it
