### Verified. However you can make it crash WAY faster by C/P a bunch of spaces. - Jared on 2017-07-10T21:25:28.641Z

### works with any characters - not just spaces, this is a pretty serious bug in my opinion as you can lock yourself out of that guild until you reinstall the client if you forget you have alot of text on your clipboard and try to paste

### Can't reproduce.
MacBook Pro (late 2013), macOS  Sierra 10.12.1, Canary build 9070; characters/spaces just continue along a solid bar without breaking, lagging or crashing the client. Textbox seems to have a character cap limit so repeatedly C/Ping huge paragraphs no longer breaks it
