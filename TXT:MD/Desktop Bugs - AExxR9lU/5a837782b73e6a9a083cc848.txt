Reported by houston#2248

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to User Settings 
- Click on Discord Nitro 
- See the yearly and monthly modals' bottoms with a magnifier tool

####Expected result:
Both modals should look symmetrical; they should have the same amount of pixels.
####Actual result:
The monthly modal has two more pixels in the bottom (or the yearly modal is missing two pixels).
####Client settings:
Discord Canary (Build 10636)
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (Version 1709)
