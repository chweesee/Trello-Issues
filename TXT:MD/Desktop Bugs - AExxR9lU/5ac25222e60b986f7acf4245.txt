### Can reproduce.
CR Mac Mini (Late 2012) - macOS Sierra 10.12.6 Canary Build 12955, it takes a while but it seems like there's a better chance of it appearing if theres 5 of less new messages

### Can't reproduce.
CNR on Discord Stable Build 13009 on MacBook Air 2017 Model running OSX 10.11.6, on Google Chrome 58. It may be that the stable version may not have gotten the update yet, or my Google Chrome is too outdated. I tried with multiple servers but was not able to reproduce in any way.
