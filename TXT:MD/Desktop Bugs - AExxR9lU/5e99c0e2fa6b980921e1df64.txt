####Steps to reproduce:
- Have been mentioned several times in the previous days 
- Go in the Recent Mentions tab 
- Scroll down 
- At one point, start to pay attention to the mentions you're seeing and try to remember some (in order to recognize them after the post-animation jump up)

####Expected result:
The "loading further mentions" animations does not make you jump a bunch of mentions higher, making you able to scroll fully through the recent mentions tab.
####Actual result:
The "loading futher mentions" animations, once finished, makes you jump a bunch of mentions higher. If you retry to scroll, the animation will happen again, making you unable to scroll through the entirety of the recent mentions tab.
####Client settings:

####System settings:
