####Steps to reproduce:
- Be in a server with access to modifying permissions of the roles below you without your role being the highest one or being the owner 
- Go to the permissions of a role that is above your highest one 
- Hover over the color attribute or the rest of the permissions

####Expected result:
All of these options will show some error regarding the highest role being below the role you're attempting to modify
####Actual result:
For the role color it shows "Disabled for everyone" and for the rest there is no text being shown
