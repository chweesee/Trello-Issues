####Steps to reproduce:
- Person A calls Person B in a group call (or directly) 
- Without either person leaving the call, Person A calls Person B in a different group call (or directly, if Step 1 was not a direct call) 
- Note that Person A is not properly added to the call and must press Join Call to enter. Person A presses Join Call to enter the call. 
- Person B presses Leave Call. Continue speaking and note that Person B has not actually left the call, even though their UI shows that they are not in the call. Person B must press the Join Call button on the UI, then the Leave Call button again to successfully leave.

####Expected result:
In Step 3, Person A should have been automatically added to the call they started. In Step 4, Person B should have left.
####Actual result:
In Step 3, Person A is not added to the call. In Step 4, Person B remains in the call even though the UI shows they left
