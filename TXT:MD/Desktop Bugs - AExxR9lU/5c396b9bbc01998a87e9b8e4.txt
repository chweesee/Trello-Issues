####Steps to reproduce:
- React with an emoji, for example tarekban would be a good example. You can also go into <#411645018105970699> and find an reaction with the tarekban. 
- Click on the three dots menu in the message. 
- Hit on Reactions to view the menu

####Expected result:
Emojis should look normal as if it's more centered.
####Actual result:
Emojis look squished as if someone is stepping on it a bit.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary Build 30816
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64 (1809)
