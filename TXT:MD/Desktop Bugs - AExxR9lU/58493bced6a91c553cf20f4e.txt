[Archived] When you try to join a guild and you are already on 100 guilds, you (in the past) got a "Maximum Guilds Reached (100)" message. Now, it acts like the link is expired or invalid, even if it's the guild cap causing the issue. (https://trello.com/c/uF1iLHpA)

P3: Will get fixed eventually

### Additionally, valid links used to pop up the ✅ bubble, even at 100 servers, and only changed to a ❌ when clicked. Now, they all appear expired.

### I checked with the devs, there never was an appropriate error message, it just errored. There should be an appropriate error message I agree.  But very low priority. - Jared on 2016-12-12T19:43:31.494Z
