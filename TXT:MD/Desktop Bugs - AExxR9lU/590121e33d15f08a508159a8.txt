Reported by Terminator966#1194

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Right click on a message in chat. 
- Use a TAYNE keyboard shortcut that opens a menu or moves your channel. (ex. Ctrl+shift+n) 

####Expected result:
 The menu you see after right clicking a message in chat goes away after using TAYNE like it does when you click away. 
####Actual result:
 Menu stays and can cause overlaps (in Ctrl+shift+/ and Ctrl+shift+n) 
####System settings:
