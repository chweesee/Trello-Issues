####Steps to reproduce:
- Navigate to a chat with enough messages to fill the chat enough to scroll 
- Position the chat so that the line under the channel topic is over text (easier to observe if you're using letters like p, y, or j)

####Expected result:
Solid line with no text overlap
####Actual result:
Text overlap on the line
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.207, Build 14602
####System settings:
