Reported by ethanlaj#8805

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to the discord developers website, make sure you are using discord’s web browser (on mobile) 
- Go to applications and open up one 
- Click one of the copy buttons 
- Exit out of the browser, back to discord 
- Paste into a text channel

####Expected result:
The value you copied on the developers website should be pasted into the text channel typing box
####Actual result:
The value you copied is never actually copied, so you either paste in something that is “old” on your clipboard, or you don’t paste anything at all
####Client settings:
Stable (mobile)
####System settings:
iOS 11.4.1, iPhone 7
