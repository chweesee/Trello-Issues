####Steps to reproduce:Find someone you can start a call with. 
- Start the call like any regular call 
- Start a screenshare of any window (I started while Discord was still ringing the other person) 
- If they pick up, have them leave 
- Right click their name (either at the top of DMs or from a message they have sent) 
- Click call 
- Observe

####Expected result:
Discord starts ringing the person you clicked ring on w/o screenshare stopping
####Actual result:
Discord rings the other person and screenshare closes/crashes
