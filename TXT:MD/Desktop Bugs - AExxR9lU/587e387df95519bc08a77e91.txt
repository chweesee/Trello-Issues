Reported by score#6846

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Type a message with wide characters (ｆｕｌｌｗｉｄｔｈ　ｃｈａｒａｃｔｅｒｓ or just lots of wide capital letters), enough to fill about a line of the textbox 
- Continue typing until the text wraps 

####Expected result:
 The textbox should resize to fit the newly wrapped text 
####Actual result:
 The textbox only displays a single line of text and must be scrolled with the cursor keys
