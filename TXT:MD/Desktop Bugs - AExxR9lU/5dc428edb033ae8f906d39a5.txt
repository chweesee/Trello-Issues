Tapping the three dots to edit a message that contains enough embeds that the single message takes up more space than you can view on the screen causes chat to scroll down to the bottom of the message, moving the message content that you are editing off of the screen (https://trello.com/c/76jw0E2P)

Reported by binchlord#0998

####Steps to reproduce:
- Send a message with multiple embeds, long enough that you cannot fit the full message on the screen, 3+ trello links works 
- Tap the three dots and hit edit

####Expected result:
The chat should remain stationary so that the message content you are editing remains on the screen, or scroll up as editing with the up arrow key does to ensure that the message content is at the top of the screen
####Actual result:
The chat scrolls down and prevents you from seeing the message you are editing
