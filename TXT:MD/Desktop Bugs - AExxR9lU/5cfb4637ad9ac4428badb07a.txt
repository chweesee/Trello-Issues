####Steps to reproduce:
- Must have a non-admin role that's above the admin role 
- Select role that has a locked 'Administrator' permission switch, but otherwise is editable (admin permission must be enabled and locked) 
- Select second role that also has the 'Administrator' permission locked either on or off 
- Select a fully editable, non-admin role 
- Select the second role again 
- Select the initial role; the 'Administrator' permission is now changeable

####Expected result:
The 'Administrator' permission switch should stay locked.
####Actual result:
The 'Administrator' permission switch is unlocked and can be switched off, leading to locking yourself out of admin permissions.
