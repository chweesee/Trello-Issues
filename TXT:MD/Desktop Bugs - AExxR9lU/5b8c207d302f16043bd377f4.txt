- put your client on min width (e.g. when on Splitscreen) 
- go to Server Settings > Roles 
- click on any role and edit the role name, typing a long name into the text bar

Can reproduce - note: The last row of colors does not display no matter how large the window is. However, it will show once you type a role name of 27 characters or more in length.
