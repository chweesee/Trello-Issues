Reported by Middy#3643

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to Server Settings > Overview 
- Click "Upload Image" (Not "Change Icon", which appears when hovering over the current icon) 
- Select an image that isn't square

####Expected result:
The preview should show a cropped version of the image, rather than a distorted/squashed one. i.e. It should show the same result as when using the "Change Icon" button
####Actual result:
Non-square images are squashed to fit the preview. This is not representative of the final result, as clicking the save button will then update it to the correct, cropped preview. Works fine when uploading via the other (Change Icon) button.
####Client settings:
Discord Stable 0.0.297 and Canary 0.0.154
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64, Creators update
