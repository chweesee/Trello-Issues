Reported by Rashaun#9295

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a server where you have a role that has invite perms enabled in settings but disabled in channel settings 
- Right click a user that isn't in the server 
- Mouse over the "Invite to Server" option and observe you have the option to invite to that server 
- Try inviting the user to that server from the right click context menu

####Expected result:
No option to invite user to that server since invites are denied in every channel
####Actual result:
Able to select that server from the context menu even though clicking it doesn't send an invite
####Client settings:
Canary Build 19006
####System settings:
