Reported by 54D [Hibernation]#1357

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open DM invite box. 
- Scroll down a bit. 
- Move your cursor around so it hovers on top of a certain user and highlights him/her. 
- Use arrow keys to move the selection up or down. Make sure you do not scroll the selection area. 
- Confirming that the selection is someone above or below the user that your cursor is hovering over, move your cursor carefully so that it stays in the area of that user.

####Expected result:
Moving your cursor refreshes the selection and the user which the cursor is on top of will be highlighted instantly.
####Actual result:
Member is not highlighted, cursor must move outside the user's selection area. Clicking on the user adds him/her to the list of members, but still doesn't highlight.
