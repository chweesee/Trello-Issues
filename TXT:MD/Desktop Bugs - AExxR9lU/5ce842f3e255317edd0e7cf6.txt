- When on the menu, size the window down until the button area overlaps with the other UI elements and some of the text even goes out of modal.

### Can reproduce.
MacBook Pro: macOS Catalina 10.15; Discord Canary 48030 - I cannot reproduce this, but I have an extension off this (according to bug hunters). My Notification Settings window does not scale to the current window size. It's always a set height, and thus if you have a small window, it will not adjust itself accordingly.
