Reported by 󠀀󠀀 󠀀󠀀#8690

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open a program (I used Google Chrome) 
- Rename the program with a game available in Discord library 
- Look at the game in Discord library

####Expected result:
The program shouldn't be recognized as the game itself
####Actual result:
It makes the program act like the game being unable to launch it since it thinks it has been launched

CR | HP Windows 10 Home v1803, OS Build 17134.1, [BUILD INFO] Release Channel: canary, Build Number: 34463, Version Hash: 9bf4ca200d422d191dd60299109737c01ce2a0a2,
[NATIVE INFO] host 0.0.233, doesn't have to be a game in your library, it can be any game in the Discord Store (I tried Tooth & Tail that was in my library and Grand Theft Auto V which is not in my library) if you rename a program to any game in the store it makes it look like you are playing said game when you are not.
