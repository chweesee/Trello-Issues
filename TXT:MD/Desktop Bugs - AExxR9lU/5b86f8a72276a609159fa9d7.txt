####Steps to reproduce:

- Enter Discord Nitro menu in user settings 
- Shrink the Discord client window horizontally 
- Notice the close button disappear (cancel button is roughly where it would be) 
- This also applies to some other tabs (e.g. HypeSquad)

####Expected result:
The close button should still be visible, rather than requiring the user to expand the window further
####Actual result:
The cancel subscription button takes the place of the close button (dangerous in more ways than one) üòâ
####Client settings:

### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Pro x64, Release Channel: Canary 22726 | PTB 22658 | This bug is also reproducable when you don't have Nitro. This effect stays as well after moving away from the nitro tab but staying in the settings. Once the Cancel button is out of the window, it will not recover until you close down your settings.
