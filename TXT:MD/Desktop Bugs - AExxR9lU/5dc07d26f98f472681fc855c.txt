Reported by Immotay#3150

####Steps to reproduce:
- Set your Date/Time settings to (UTC -03:00) Brasilia 
- Seems like that actually BEING in Brazil might be a factor so using a VPN might help

####Expected result:
Correct time stamps
####Actual result:
the time stamps are one hour ahead, as if we were on daylight savings (UTC -02:00). While your PC displays UTC -03:00.
####Client settings:
Stable 48470
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro 1903 (build 18362.418)
