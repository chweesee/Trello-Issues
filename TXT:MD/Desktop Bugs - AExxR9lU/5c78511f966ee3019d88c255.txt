####Steps to reproduce:
- Be on Canary 32982 
- Join a VC in a server that has about 30-40 people 
- (Maybe also a fast moving text channel in the same server?) 
- Observe Canary clinet

####Expected result:
The Canary client is supposed to be working smoothly, like my stable client was in the GIF.
####Actual result:
The Canary client completely breaks, and ending task in task manager and restarting canary won't fix it.
####Client settings:
canary, Build Number: 32982, Version Hash: 48a50ea2ceed8b163528fea3183e6be2cec7b8e6
####System settings:
Win10 Pro x64 (1809)
