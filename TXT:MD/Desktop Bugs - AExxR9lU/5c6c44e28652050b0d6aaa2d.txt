Reported by Casper#9999

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to the Canary web version of Discord (using the latest stable Google Chrome version, Chrome OS) 
- Make sure your desktop has a mousepad to navigate horizontally, look in my video how I desperately try to scroll up and then sidewards inside the server list region, and it works

####Expected result:
You shouldn't be able to scroll horizontally in the server list sidebar.
####Actual result:
You can scroll horizontally in the server list sidebar.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary Browser, 31785
####System settings:
HP Chromebook 11 G5 EE, Chrome OS 71 (64-bit)
