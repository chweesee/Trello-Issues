####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Server Settings on a server without an icon 
- Change the server name to something with more than 6 words separated by spaces 
- (Note: when exiting the server settings, look at the side, and see how it isn't cut-off)

####Expected result:
The server icon rendered at the side is like the one in the settings.
####Actual result:
The server icon on the settings has cut-off words (which also are ignoring the circular frame)
####Client settings:
0.0.157 Canary (Latest)
####System settings:
Windows 10 15063.413
