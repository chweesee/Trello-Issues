### This is not a bug. The entire point of holding shift is that it doesn't close the emoji picker when you click something. It is not a bug that it does exactly what it's supposed to.

If you feel like it _should_ close the emoji picker in this specific situation, that's a feature request. - Jared on 2019-01-02T18:41:39.985Z
