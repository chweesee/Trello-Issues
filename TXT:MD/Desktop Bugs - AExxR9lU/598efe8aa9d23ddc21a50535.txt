### Verified, but only happens with large servers whos results aren't cached. Try going into DTesters and searching for "bug", then immediately open the user settings after hitting enter. Should be 2-3 seconds before the UI becomes responsive. - Jared on 2017-08-14T21:31:42.642Z


### Can't reproduce.
Discord Canary 0.0.163 , Windows 10 x64 Pro

### Can reproduce.
This is not exclusive to large servers, it happens on my server with only 100 members (it resulted in the "crap, we dropped the magnifying glass" error). Windows 10 Pro (64-bit), Anniversary Update (Build 1607), Canary 0.0.163 (Build 4820)

### Can reproduce.
Can STILL reproduce on Windows 10 Pro x64 Creators Update (1703), Canary 0.0.164 (build 5478). Freezing happens on every server regardless of size, even when just pressing Ctrl + F.

### Can reproduce.
This is extremely easy to reproduce and I don't understand why it's a P3. Client freezing is (imo) a P1/P0 issue. Windows 10 Pro (64-bit), Anniversary Update (Build 1607), Canary 0.0.164 (Build 5478)

### Discord also uses up to 30% of my CPU when it's frozen.

Tiemen#0107 - Bug Bot on 2017-10-07T22:10:17.568Z


### Can reproduce.
Discord Canary 0.0.165 (Build 5787) on Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (Build 1607), this is a severe issue since, When I try to search Discord will fully crash, because it starts using 40-50% CPU on my 4690k which is overclocked to 4,3 GHz. 

Search is pretty much useless on Canary as of right now, on stable this doesn't occur at all.
