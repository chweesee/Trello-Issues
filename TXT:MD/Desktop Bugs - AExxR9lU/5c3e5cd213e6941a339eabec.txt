####Steps to reproduce:
- Go on a server where you can manage permissions 
- Create a new Category 
- Create a new channel on it 
- Edit permissions of Category 
- Sync the permissions of the channel without validating 
- When you have the validating pop-up, do enter multiple time 
- Now click out 
- (On the video, the virtual keyboard is there just to distinguish between click and enter)

####Expected result:
The pop-up is not duplicated, so the click-out gets us out of the validation
####Actual result:
Pop-up is duplicate. We have to click as many times as we have done enter to get out
####Client settings:
canary, Build Number: 30873
####System settings:
