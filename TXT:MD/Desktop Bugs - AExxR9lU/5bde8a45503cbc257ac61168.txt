####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure you have the new invite model. 
- Click on the plus (+) button at the bottom of the servers. 
- Click "Join a server". 
- Observe the invite models.

####Expected result:
It should be darker, or have the yellow text like Android and iOS. (Not having the yellow text may be a designer choice, but thought it was a bit weird how android and iOS has it while desktop doesn't).
####Actual result:
It's grey, and little hard to read the invite model.
####Client settings:
Discord Stable 27458
####System settings:
Widnows 10 Pro, x64 (v1803)
