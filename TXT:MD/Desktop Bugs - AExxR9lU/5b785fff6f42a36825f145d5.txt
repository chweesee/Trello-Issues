- Go to the Activity tab. 
- Find a game that is a beta game for the Discord store. (i.e. Hollow Knight) 
- Right click on the name of the game. 
- Observe the "View in Store" button.

####Expected result:
If the user does not have access to the store, there should not be anything in that context menu.
####Actual result:
The button "View in Store" is visible, selecting it just reloads the Activity tab.
