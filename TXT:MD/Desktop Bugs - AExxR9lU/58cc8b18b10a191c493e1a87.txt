### I can't exactly unplug the router here, but I tried to simulate it by removing the internet connection.  Cannot reproduce. Once Discord reloaded it was fine. - Jared on 2017-04-17T22:51:51.575Z

### As Dabbit was unable to reproduce just by removing the internet connection, it might be specific to the router being unplugged.
