####Steps to reproduce:
- Get two members in a server chat 
- Make one send a message 
- Using the one that sent a message, change its username 
- Using the second account and in the same channel the message was sent in, type @ 
- Old username appears and will fail to mention the person 
- Note: This is actually a problem of username not updating in chat history, problem is fixed with a client reboot. Makes it easier to test/repro if you treat it that way

####Expected result:
Either the username in the @ autofill should change, or it should not appear.
####Actual result:
The old username appears, and the @ mention fails
