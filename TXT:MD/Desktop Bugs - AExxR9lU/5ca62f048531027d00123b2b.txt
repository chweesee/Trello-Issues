Reported by Rage#9991

####Steps to reproduce:
- Call someone on the browser 
- Turn on the camera 
- Turn off the camera 
- Observe

####Expected result:
The camera is supposed to turn off, for example on my Macbook the green light next to the camera stays on, which means the camera is active even though it really isn't.
####Actual result:
Camera stays active until tab refreshed or browser is closed
####Client settings:
Canary 35059
####System settings:
macOS Mojave 10.14, Chrome 73.0.3683.86
