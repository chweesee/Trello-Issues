Reported by Rauf I.#3260

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to User Settings 
- Keybinds 
- and set a keybind for push to mute I used (Numpad /) 
- once set, press it 
- hear the push to mute noise

####Expected result:
You shouldn't be able to hear the push to mute noise since keybinds are disabled in that window
####Actual result:
You hear the noise, meaning that the keybind works in that window
####Client settings:
Canary 0.0.163
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64 CU
