Reported by Rohul1997#6787

####Steps to reproduce: 
- using a web automation app like zapier create a twitter trigger, making sure that the tweet your trying to send has multiple lines. 
- Go through the whole process of creating a custom request and use the webhook link from discord. 
- Fill in the data section so it sends in rich embed form, include the twitter text as 1 of the embed fields. 
- Finalize the process and begin the test 

####Expected result:
 The webhook should send the rich embed and if the tweet has multi lines it should output the results in multi lines 
####Actual result:
 The webhook doesn't send the rich embed 
####System settings:
 Win 10 x64, Discord Canary
