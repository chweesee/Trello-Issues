####Steps to reproduce:
- Have Video Calls (If Discord Dev, easy) 
- Goto a server in which you have perms to move channels 
- Try to move the pip to that corner, highlighting a channel while you move the PiP.

####Expected result:
Only the PiP Menu Moves
####Actual result:
Both are selected and move around
