####Steps to reproduce:
- play League in any mode (Windowed, Fullscreen, Borderless) 
- have Discord Overlay enabled 
- (preferably use the regular keybindings) 
- press and hold Shift, Alt, A or Rightclick (or other keys used in the game) 
- (additionally any ability key will work if said ability is a chargeable one) 
- on top of that, access the overlay via your overlay shortcut 
- (right)click back into the game and try to continue playing normally

####Expected result:
the game goes on normally
####Actual result:
Depending on mode, the game gets stuck in shift-mode or is unresponsive at all. No button will work before tabbing out. This might include Esc, all Abilities or "ping only".
####Client settings:
Canary, Build Number 9681

### The bug that riot reported to me was that they would enable the overlay, it would never appear and then there was no possible way to interact with the application until you closed the overlay.

I managed to reproduce the issue where the modifier is acting as though it's still held down, but not the non-responsiveness. - Jared on 2018-01-26T20:41:26.268Z
