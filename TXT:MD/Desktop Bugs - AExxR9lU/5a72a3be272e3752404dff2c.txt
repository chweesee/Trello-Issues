### Can reproduce.
CR, Windows 10 Professional x64 - Fall Creators Update, Discord Canary Build 10094. However, you do NOT have to pin the message in order to reproduce it. You need to paste it several times, then keep on editing until you see the editting stamp being cut off, you can see the screenshot from my attempt.

### Can reproduce.
CR, macBook Pro, macOS 10.13.3, Canary 10094. No need for pin, just edit it to have enough of those line characters to force (edited) to wrap.
