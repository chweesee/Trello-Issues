Short Desc.: Clicking a username link in a channel topic (basically a mention) in the channel topic popup shows the user but behind the popup.
Steps to repo:
1) go to a channel topic
2) type a user hyperlink, for example: <@116013677060161545>
3) save and click the channel topic
4) when the channel topic pops up, click the username
Expected Result: Not sure, maybe it either shows above the popup or not at all.
Actual Result: It shows up behind the popup.
