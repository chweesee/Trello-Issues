Reported by analog#9481

####Steps to reproduce:
- Start from viewing the Home page (i.e. not a Server) 
- Enter a Server you can invite people into with the button, like a new Server. The button is the one near the profile picture icon with sparkles and the green '+' reading 'An adventure begins...' 
- Enter a different Server that would ordinarily not display that box. 
- Notice you can still see the box, and click the 'Invite People' though the link that appears inside does not match the link for the server (e.g. 'discord-testers' is missing after the `discord,gg/`)

####Expected result:
It should at least display the correct link, if it is supposed to remain in the second server.
####Actual result:
The button remains, and does not produce a valid server link.
