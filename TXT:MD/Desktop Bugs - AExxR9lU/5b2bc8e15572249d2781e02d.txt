####Steps to reproduce:
- Open up Discord 
- Check to make sure the game is added, and that you enable Discord Overlay in the settings 
- Open a game that has the settings enabled

####Expected result:
The game should load up with the Discord Overlay on the side
####Actual result:
It doesn't appear anymore. I also note that this issue was pre-relevent in an old version of Discord Normal.
