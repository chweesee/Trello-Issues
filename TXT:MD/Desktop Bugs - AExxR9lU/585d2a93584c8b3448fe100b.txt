####Steps to reproduce: 
- Go to your role color picker 
- Type in a value like FFAABB 
- Place a # before the HEX code and remove it 
- Observe that the color picker position stays the same, but the actual color changes 

####Expected result:
 The color should stay the same regardless of # 
####Actual result:
 effects the actual set color value, but not the color picker's position.
