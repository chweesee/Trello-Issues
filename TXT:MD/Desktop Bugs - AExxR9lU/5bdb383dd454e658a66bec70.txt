####Steps to reproduce:
- Step 1: Search for something in a channel 
- Step 2: Click on "Relevant" searches 
- Step 3: Now click onto another server 
- Step 4: Now go back to the same server you searched in 
- Step 5: Now it goes back to "Recent" and shows "Relevant" searches

####Expected result:
It shouldn't show "Recent" as selected and show "Relevant" searches. It should stay on the filter you clicked on.
####Actual result:
It should say showing Relevant searches instead of Recent. It says "Recent" filter and shows "Relevant" searches
