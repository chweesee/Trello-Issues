####Steps to reproduce:
- Go into a Voice Channel where you don't have the "Go Live" permission 
- See that the "Go Live" button shows up 
- Click it 
- Select an application or screen 
- Click the green "Go Live" button 
- Your stream may start for up to a few seconds, and then the stream gets disconnected

####Expected result:
The button to go live should be hidden, greyed out, or not clickable.
####Actual result:
The button is fully working and a (albeit very short) stream can be started, and seen by others.
