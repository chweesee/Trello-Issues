####Steps to reproduce:
- Press "Edit Channel" to edit any channel 
- Go to "Permissions" 
- Make sure you have a Roles/Members override (If not create one) 
- Edit the permissions of any Role/Member or @everyone 
- Do not press the "Save Changes" that pops up 
- Switch to any other Role/Member override 
- Scroll down and press "Remove " 
- On the PopUp press "Okay"

####Expected result:
The role override should be gone/deleted
####Actual result:
Nothin will happen. The PopUp will close but the role override will stay there
####Client settings:

### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Home x64 v1803, Canary 27040 - - It appears as though Discord saves the information that you are editing as current changes rather than previous ones. The "current permissions," as observed by another user if they open permissions for that channel do not include the role. If you hit save, the role is added again, and if you hit reset it deletes the role because Discord has the current permissions saved without it.

### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Home x64 v1803, Canary 27040 - - I can reproduce, however I think that it's honestly better now where it keeps the new permissions in your cache. You can still hit "reset" to continue deleting the role so it's not a big deal.
