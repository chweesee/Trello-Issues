####Steps to reproduce:
- Paste a spotify playlist into any channel (embed enabled) 
- Once the embed shows up, zoom in/out

####Expected result:
The embed becomes bigger/smaller and scales properly
####Actual result:
The track duration to the right gets cut off if zooming out below default, everything track related disappears if zooming in above default.

Discord Canary, 0.0.164
