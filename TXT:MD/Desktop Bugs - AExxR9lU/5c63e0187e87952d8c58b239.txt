Reported by n0tjyxgsgs#8987

####Steps to reproduce:
- (AUSDOM ANC8 Active Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones, but bug is probably reproducible with any Bluetooth headphones. I use an audio jack for output and the Bluetooth function for input, as the headphones do not support input through the audio jack.) 
- Plug in headphone jack, turn on headphones + pair with computer 
- Select 'Speakers' as default output device (for me there is no 'audio jack' option, the 'Speakers' output device uses audio jack) 
- Select 'Headset' as default input device 
- Join voice chat (with 'Default' for both of Discord's device settings)

####Expected result:
Discord uses the default devices: outputs audio through the headphone jack and receives input via Bluetooth
####Actual result:
Discord receives input but does not output audio to audio jack. Changing output device on Discord to 'Headset' fixes.
