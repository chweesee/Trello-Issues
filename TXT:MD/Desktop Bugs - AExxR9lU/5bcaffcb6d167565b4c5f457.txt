####Steps to reproduce:
- Have someone upload and send an audio file to you. 
- Press the play button

####Expected result:
I'm guessing that the audio should play with a lower CPU usage. I noticed a 15-20% increase on multiple computers.
####Actual result:
CPU usage increases 15-20%.
####Client settings:
Build Number: 26340
