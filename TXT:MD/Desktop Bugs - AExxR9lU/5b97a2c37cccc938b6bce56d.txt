Reported by glitchperfect#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- go to Developer Portal documentation 
- navigate to a topic (like Channel) 
- click on a "subheading" (like Modify Channel)

####Expected result:
The content should jump to the selected subheading.
####Actual result:
On Edge: Content flickers and it goes back to the top of the main topic. On Firefox: 1st click does nothing, 2nd click activates the right heading, after that it toggles between 1st and chosen heading. Copied Urls also not working.
####Client settings:
Firefox 63 (Dev Edition), Edge 17744 (Slow Ring)
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro 17744 (Slow Ring)
