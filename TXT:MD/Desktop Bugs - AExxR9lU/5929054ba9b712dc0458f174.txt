### I can't reproduce this, I need more information. Specifically:

- How many times has this been checked on a voice region that is NOT US South?
- What is the minimum number of people needed to reproduce this?
Can you reproduce this using a as the source of sound?
- Does this bug happen to everyone in the voice group? Or just one person? If one person, is that person a random member of the group? Or is it always the same members?
- Can this bug be reproduced on the PTB/Stable clients?
- Can a voice debug log be provided when the error occurs? - Jared on 2017-05-30T18:44:19.721Z

### The default input / output settings are causing corruption in discords voice system. However, if you change your output/input settings to something else it will never crash. Ever

Mr.Caleb#8593 - Bug Bot on 2017-06-13T19:21:59.592Z


### Steps to Reproduce: 
- Join a voice channel
- Make sure your settings for output/input are both on 'Default'
- After 20 or minutes (up to an hour r more) the connection will randomely drop, crashing the client in some cases
- Join the same voice channel and turn your output/input settings to a different device (i.e. RealTek Headphones/Microphone)
- You will not experience a crash ever again.

Something with default input/output settings seem to be the root cause for the crashes. This has been tested with multiple users and each result has been fantastic. No crashes

### Can reproduce.
crashing doesn't happen after following new reproduction steps. Windows 10 x64 bit, Canary 0.0.157
