####Steps to reproduce:Create a Bot 
- Create a Rich Embed builder 
- Add a very long single word to either the footer or the author name 
- let the Bot post the embed.

####Expected result:
The embed should stretch accordingly to the word size/based on the size of the discord window  or atleast flow to a new line like the rest.
####Actual result:
The embed's footer/author name is cut off.
####Client settings:
Stable 0.0.300 - Version 9672
####System settings:
Win10 Pro x64
