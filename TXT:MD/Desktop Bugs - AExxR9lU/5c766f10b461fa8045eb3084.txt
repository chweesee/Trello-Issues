####Steps to reproduce:
- Have server settings configured for an AFK channel, and a duration of 15 minutes or greater for the timeout. Also, have user status set to online. 
- Join a different channel besides AFK, then stop being active (No input to mouse or keyboard). 
- After 10 minutes, your status will change to idle (yellow circle) accordingly. 
- After the set AFK duration, you will get moved. Once this happens, your idle status will change back to online (green circle), even though you aren't really active again.

####Expected result:
Status should remain idle since the user is inactive.
####Actual result:
User status is forced back to online inappropriately.
