####Steps to reproduce:
- Press @ and click on someone in the selector 
- Press Backspace

####Expected result:
The message box still has rounded corners
####Actual result:
The top corners of the message box are sharp, as if the mention selector is there. If you press Ctrl+A and delete everything, the corners are still sharp.
