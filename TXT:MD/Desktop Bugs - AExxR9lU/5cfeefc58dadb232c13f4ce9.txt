####Steps to reproduce:
- You need to have some skype accounts with friends on your PC for this to work. (I had 11 accounts) 
- Go to Settings tab 
- Go to Connections 
- Click on the Skype logo

####Expected result:
You're supposed to see a clear, and not squashed message with maybe a scroll for the list (?)
####Actual result:
You can see that you get a message with squashed content and the "Enable" button is splitted up in half
####Client settings:
Release Channel: canary, Build Number: 39387, Version Hash: 0da88997edbfbb9a7afaba0d74ac01b74c6f804e
