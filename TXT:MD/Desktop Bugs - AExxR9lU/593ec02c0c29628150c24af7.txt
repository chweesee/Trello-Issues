### In order to repro without a crashed voice server: Change region to somewhere such as Sydney and use the Dev Tools "Network" tab to throttle internet speeds. I found that 5000ms, 1 kb/s, 1 kb/s, allows for the greatest amount of time to catch the bug in action.

### The error below is spammed very quickly in console.

### Another way to repo:  - Connect to a voice channel  - Open RTC debug menu - Get removed from the server the voice channel is part of / delete the channel- Click on User section in RTC panel
