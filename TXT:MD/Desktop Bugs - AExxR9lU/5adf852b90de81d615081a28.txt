### Can reproduce.
this seems to actually be caused if your client receives a message in the small window between you sending a message and the server confirming or by changing to a different channel/server before the server confirmed. the channel must be scrolled away for it to show the current channel is unread Windows 10 1709 x64, Canary build 14045
