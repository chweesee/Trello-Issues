[Archived] Discord crashes when attempting to jump to deleted messages in Search. Note: Crashes appear to occur sporadically, similar to the Audit Log crashes, so this could take several attempts. (https://trello.com/c/V1H965Um)

P3: Will get fixed eventually,

### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Home x64, Canary  0.0.189 (8849). Might have to retry the steps multiple times before it crashes. It's not a 100% repro bug but it does happen every now and then. Try pressing the Jump button to the deleted message more than once as well.

### Can reproduce.
CR, Windows 10 x64 Fall Creators Update, Canary 8849. Happens very sparingly, try to spam around when jumping. Happens like 5% of the time for me...
