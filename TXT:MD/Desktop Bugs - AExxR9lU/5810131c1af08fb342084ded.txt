### Tested on latest canary as of writing:

I can no longer reproduce this myself. Sending a picture and then holding shift with a right-click delete messages removes it instantly.

Clicking the three dots and choosing delete while holding shift doesn't do this though, but this behaviour is mimic'd by normal messages which also don't do this. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-04-25T00:48:55.050Z
