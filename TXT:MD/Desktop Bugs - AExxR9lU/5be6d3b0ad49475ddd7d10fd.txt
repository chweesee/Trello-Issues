####Steps to reproduce:
- Be the Owner of a Server that shows the Owner Crown and change the length of your name to get truncated in the member list 
- Change your language to German (and restart your client) 
- Hover over the Server Owner Crown and observe the tooltip

####Expected result:
The tooltip is moved to the left to fit into the client (as e.g. the Help tooltip does)
####Actual result:
THe tooltip gets out of bounds and you are unable to read what it says
