Reported by Krpajda#0001

####Steps to reproduce:post multiple images as a part of a single message from android 
- copy links to both images into a single message 
- copy this message (the multiple links) into a text input on desktop 
- make the entire message a spoiler tag by adding [spoiler][spoiler][space] in front and [space][spoiler][spoiler] behind the message 
- the spoiler does not highlight as it should in the text box 
- post the message 
- now whenever the link to one of the images is posted anywhere, all the previous images also post

####Expected result:
only the linked image should show up, just like when you open the link in browser
####Actual result:
all images previous to the one linked in the spoilered message show up. Sometimes, even in-line
####Client settings:
android 10.2.4(1039) (im not able to join android beta), desktop canary 55309
####System settings:
android 9 (nokia 6.2), win10
