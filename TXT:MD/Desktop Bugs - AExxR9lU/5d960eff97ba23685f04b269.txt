####Steps to reproduce:Go to a Nitro Boosted server, get into a channel, initiate a Go Live stream, change the stream quality to 720p 60FPS. Click on a voice channel on another non Nitro Boosted Server, click Go Live and the stream will keep previous configurations (720p 60 FPS).

####Expected result:
Go Live should change the quality back to 720p 30FPS automatically.
####Actual result:
Everything goes normal as it should be, but the stream keeps the high quality 720p 60FPS from the Nitro Boosted server.
