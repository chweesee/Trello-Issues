### Only happens when going to the page through another discordapp.com page, using the "Open Discord" Button makes it work normal though when opening it through a page like discordapp.com/login it happens.

### Occurs through any form of navigation to problematic pages for me. Tested: direct URL navigation, Open button on discordapp.com (navbar), Open Discord button on discordapp.com (hero), Login page to channels/@me page.
