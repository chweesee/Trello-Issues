None

Reported by FireController1847#3577

####Steps to reproduce:
- Move your mouse up and down across multiple channels and monitor task manager. 
- Type. Literally typing a message causes the issue as well.

####Expected result:
No high CPU/GPU usage.
####Actual result:
A 30-50% jump in CPU/GPU usage while doing the action.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 18027 & Discord Browser
####System settings:
Windows 10 x64 v1803
**Note:** I'd assume to see a small 1-5% jump because of animations and such, but 30-50% is very large.

### Can reproduce.
CR. I can definitely notice some high CPU usage even on hovering some things. Macbook Air (Early 2015), macOS Sierra 10.12.6 Discord Canary (Build 18043)

### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 and Canary 18027

### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (Build 16299) | Discord Canary (Build 18027). Discord used up to 45% of my CPU. This certainly should NOT be normal when performing basic tasks such as hovering over different modals, scrolling, etc. Processor: i3-540 @ 3.07 GHz

### This is not a duplicate as it also happens when you type or many other things. And that's ridiculous if they think that browsers should take 30-50% CPU with literally fade animations. That is __not__ normal and __is__ a bug (I've done my fare share of fading and such).

### Also, the referenced card was resulted in an issue with "the three dots", which don't exist anymore (at least from what I can tell).

### This is not a bug. Animations happen when you do these things, specifically the "..." appearing/disappearing. - Jared on 2018-07-02T16:35:28.868Z


### Moved from User Reported Bugs to Not a Bug by Jared on 2018-07-02T16:35:33.218Z


### Not a bug? I'm sorry? I have used many, many, many web applications all of which had animations. If just the "..." is causing 30-50% CPU usage, that is definitely a bug. Simply having dots resize and move a little should not cause such high CPU. The same goes for the animations over channels, and particularly just straight up typing. If your animations are using 30-50% CPU, it is not our fault. If you truly don't think this is a bug, then give us the option to disable animations because it makes Discord essentially unusable particularly on low end machines.
