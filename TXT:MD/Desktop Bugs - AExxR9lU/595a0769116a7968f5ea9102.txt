### According to Stan there is nothing we can do to prevent this. However, since images don't appear in notifications, it's a non-issue. - Jared on 2017-09-26T01:02:11.645Z

### We could theoretically fix this for desktop notifications i believe? But mobile would require some more things. - Amadeus on 2017-09-26T01:56:45.074Z
