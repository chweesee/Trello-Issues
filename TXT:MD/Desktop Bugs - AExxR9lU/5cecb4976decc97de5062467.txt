Reported by Micael Jarniac#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open the profile of a user that has the in-game status 
- Click on either the game name or the icon, the game pop-up should appear 
- On the pop-up, repeat the steps above by clicking on the user and then on the game name or icon 
- Another game pop-up should have appeared, over the previous one 
- You can now close the pop-ups by clicking outside them, and notice that only the most recent one goes away, and to get rid of them all this has to be repeated that many times

####Expected result:
When in the game pop-up, opening another pop-up shouldn't be possible, or it should replace the current one, not stack
####Actual result:
The pop-ups stack and to get out of them, they have to be closed one by one
####Client settings:
Desktop Canary, build 38594, host 0.0.238
####System settings:
Windows 10
