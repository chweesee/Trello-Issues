Reported by Asriel#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Send several private message or on server channels but each different. 
- Notice that some notifications do not disappear, even if you try to remove them. 
- Sending another message is necessary to remove it. It may be a dupe from another bug but I didn't find it, I'm really sorry if it is.

####Expected result:
After reading a message, the notification disappears, either on a PM or on a server.
####Actual result:
After reading a message, the notification does not disappear and it is necessary to send a message back to remove it.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.211
####System settings:
macOS Mojave 14.2
