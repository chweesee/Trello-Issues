### Can reproduce.
Technically not text, but discord has prompted it as a image though. Could only affect MacOS. Look into the attachment I will place. MacBook Air 2017, High Sierra 10.13.3, Discord canary, Build Number: 14388

### Can reproduce.
Mac Mini (Late 2012) - macOS Sierra 10.12.6 Canary Build 14432, Discord is treating it as an image and not text for some reason

### Can reproduce.
Not showing as an image for me, noting is pasted. The clipboard however **do** have the text in it, and pasting works in TextEdit. Mac Book Pro 15' mid-2014, Mac Os  10.13.4, Discord stable, Build Number: 14457, Version Hash: 3b2bbc09cb6eff6066e846f118bb93dce41fdbd8
