I have one and it works for me quite well. Kinda annoying that this is here and it seems to be client side. Ubuntu 16.04 newest canary (and beastly pc so dont say that its a prosessing issue.)

### Can reproduce.
As a fix for me, I unplug the device then replug it in, then after that disconnect and reconnect to voice, solves the issue for me. Win1064Bit Discord Stable

Windows 10 Creators Update 64 bit. I've always used a Yeti and I've never had any problems, most likely driver related.

### Can reproduce.
Using a Blue Snowball, Windows 10 64-bit, trying to talk in a server I don't own, or in private 1 on 1 calls, Discord will pick up me speaking, but will not send it to the receiving party.  This seems to not be the case if you're the one hosting the room, as it was working for me earlier in an extended call for 4 hours when I owned the server.  Snowball confirmed works on Skype and Audacity, and will pick up in test on Discord.

### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Pro x64 Version 1803; Discord Public Build 15154; I do not have a blue yeti and this happened yesterday whereby I was speaking and it said I was transmitting but no one could hear me, everyone else was talking and the music bot was not transmitting (while there was music in queue).

Suhosin#6488 - Bug Bot on 2018-05-14T10:19:08.151Z


### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Home X64 v. 1803. Discord latest public build. Seems to be fixed if I open discord in the web browser and mute/unmute repeatedly

Zaphoo#1169 - Bug Bot on 2018-05-26T19:38:59.559Z


### Can reproduce.
win 10 pro x64 can reproduce discord stable. This happened to me while on a discord video/audio call. The person I was video calling with couldn‚Äôt see/hear me but I could see/hear him and I could see myself on my screen. My camera and mic were both working and I was Ethernet‚Äôd into the router which was transmitting high speed Internet. Tried restarting my laptop more than once, restarting discord more than once, we had to give up and move to hangouts
