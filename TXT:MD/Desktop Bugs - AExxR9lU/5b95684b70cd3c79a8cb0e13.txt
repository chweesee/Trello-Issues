####Steps to reproduce:Go to home 
- Go to activity 
- Have a friend who is playing a game and have it show on the bottom, below the news and announcements 
- Hover your cursor over the username (letters) 
- Observe the cursor symbol change from pointer/default to a hand 
- Click and open profile 
- Hover your cursor over the discord tag (numbers) 
- Observe no cursor symbol change from pointer/default 
- Click and profile should open

####Expected result:
Both the username (words) and the discord tag (#numbers), when hovered over, should change the cursor icon/symbol.
####Actual result:
The cursor icon/symbol only changes for the username (words) and not the discord tag (numbers).
