####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a voice channel in an uncollapsed category, around the top of your server 
- Have many people, including yourself, in this voice channel 
- Have hide names off 
- Be scrolled up to the top 
- Have enough channels and categories below the voice channel's category to reach off screen(require scrolling) 
- Collapse the voice channel's category

####Expected result:
Channels/Categories should fill in the area until the bottom of the screen
####Actual result:
Channels/Categories stop at a point, leaving a giant empty area below, sometimes without scrollbar
####Client settings:
Desktop Canary 6880

### Can reproduce.
doesnt require vc to be at the top or require you to collapse/uncollapse the category its in, collapse/uncollapsing any category below it works, being moved into a vc in an already collapsed category has the same behaviour, restarting while in vc with the category collapsed does the same, did not seem to occur in servers there the channel and category list was long enough to require scrolling, only worked if the list was almost to the bottom of the screen and extended past when categories were uncollapsed Windows 10 Home & Student, Host 0.0.246, Canary Build 40522
