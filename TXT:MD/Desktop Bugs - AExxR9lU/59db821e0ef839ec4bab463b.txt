Reported by AviationMaster/Kawaii#4793

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open an active server 
- Minimize Discord Canary 
- Hibernate the pc/laptop/transformer book etc. 
- Open the app after hibernation (wait for about 5 minutes or more) 
- (At different times) Come back from other apps. Note: Canary should be minimized

####Expected result:
It shouldn't freeze. It would just run smooth as silk
####Actual result:
It freezes and I have to wait a while. Note: It rarely happens with a slow internet, or when you are at the end of the WiFi range
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.164
####System settings:
Asus Transformer book T100TA Windows 10 Home 32-bit, x64-based processor

### I haven't verified this yet, but I can tell you for a fact it's not the bug bounty. The bug bounty involved being in an active voice chat for a _long_ period of time, typically over an hour.
