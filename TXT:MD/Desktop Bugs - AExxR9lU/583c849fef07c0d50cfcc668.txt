### This issue usually happens because someone using your IP was banned in one of your servers.  Sibling, friend, someone using Discord in a common area, etc.

The fix is to unban everyone in your banned user list. If the problem still persists try contacting support@discordapp.com - Jared on 2016-11-30T19:03:21.237Z
