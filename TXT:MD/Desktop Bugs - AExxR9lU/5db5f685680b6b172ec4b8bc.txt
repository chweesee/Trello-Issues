####Steps to reproduce:
- Turn off "Import your games" in Game Library settings 
- Make sure game isn't listed in Library tab 
- Make sure game is an "Added Game" in Game Activity settings 
- Ctrl+T 
- Type game name 
- Observe ability to launch 
- Remove game from "Added Games" in Game Activity 
- Ctrl+T 
- Type game name 
- Observe inability to launch

####Expected result:
Game should not launch when not imported into Library, but I should still be able to use Overlay feature and have game status
####Actual result:
In order to have the non-library game not show in the jump modal, the game must also be removed from Game Activity settings, causing them to lose ability to use Overlay.
####Client settings:
Desktop Canary, 48112
####System settings:
Windows 10 Education, Version 1903, Build 18362.418
