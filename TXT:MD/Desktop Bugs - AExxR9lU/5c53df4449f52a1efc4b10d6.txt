####Steps to reproduce:
- Join a server in lurkers mode. 
- Right-click on the server name, and press "leave server". 
- Notice how it gives you the warning "You won't be able to rejoin the server without an invite", when you were never part of the server in the first place. 
- OPTIONAL: Left-click on the server-name and press "leave server". Notice how it doesn't give you the warning and lets you leave the server.

####Expected result:
When leaving by right-clicking on the server name, it should not give the warning, as you were never part of the server.
####Actual result:
It gives you the warning like you were part of the server.
