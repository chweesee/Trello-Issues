####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a custom status set (emoji is not required) 
- Go to a Discord with enough channels to allow the channel list to scroll 
- Make sure you aren't scrolled all the way down in the channel list 
- Click on your profile picture at the bottom left so the status options show up 
- Hover over the status options 
- Observe, or move your mouse up and down a few times if it doesn't happen

####Expected result:
Nothing interesting should happen
####Actual result:
Sometimes "New Unreads" or a channel pops up on the bottom in front of your username
####Client settings:

### Can reproduce.
It shows what's behind it, so it could be a channel name or the new unread pop up, if any. Also, the status icons don't show for me until I hover over them. MacBook Pro: macOS Catalina 10.15.1; Safari 13.0.3 - Canary 49186
