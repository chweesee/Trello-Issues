####Steps to reproduce:
- Find someone that is playing a game 
- Make sure he is kinda at the bottom of the players list so the role add menu will be on top and not below 
- Have role add permissions 
- See the little corners not properly filled

####Expected result:
The corners are filled
####Actual result:
There is a little gap in the upper corners
####Client settings:

####System settings:
