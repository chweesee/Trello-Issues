####Steps to reproduce:
- get someone to block you (not telling you how) 
- get them to post something and let others react to it 
- try to click on one of those reactions to add it 
- watch the screen shake violently as it fails (intended behaviour) 
- watch the counter still increase

####Expected result:
counter increases, screen shakes, counter decreases
####Actual result:
screen shakes, counter increases, reaction part goes back to grey, counter stays increased till you switch channels
