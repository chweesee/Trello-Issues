####Steps to reproduce:

- Create a new account by using an invite link, and make sure you get to the page of "What should everyone call you?" and enter any name 
- Once you get into the server (skip the claiming of the account) you were invited to, leave the server and you will get a prompt to "get started" on discord 
- Click the "Get Started" button 
- Observe the animation as it slides to the next step of creating a server or getting started

####Expected result:
The slider animation should not break
####Actual result:
The slider animation does break
