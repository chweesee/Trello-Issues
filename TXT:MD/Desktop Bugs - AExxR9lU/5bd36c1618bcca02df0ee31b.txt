####Steps to reproduce:
- Switch language to Norwegian 
- Observe how the text is going underneath the right side and be disappointed you barely have friends online

####Expected result:
The "Online" text should wrap under the number of friends you have online
####Actual result:
The text goes underneath the right side instead of wrapping
####Client settings:
