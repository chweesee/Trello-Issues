### This has been happening since day 1 of the pinned messages feature, it was known before we launched with it.  It's not really a problem and we will likely not be dedicating resources to fixing it. - Jared on 2016-10-27T17:07:43.697Z


### Moved from User Reported Bugs to Won't Fix. Dead Bug by Jared on 2016-10-27T17:07:47.413Z


### Seems to have been fixed in Canary build 667.
