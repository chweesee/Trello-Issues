####Steps to reproduce:
- join a voice channel 
- mute your mic using its software/switch to trigger the input detection warning 
- when the warning appears, enable Streamer Mode 
- close the input warning banner and observe that the streamer mode banner doesn't appear 
- leave the call and observe that its showing now

####Expected result:
the streamer mode banner should appear either by automatically closing the first banner or after manually closing it
####Actual result:
the banner only appears after closing the call even though it does usually show when in calls but not when another banner is triggered
