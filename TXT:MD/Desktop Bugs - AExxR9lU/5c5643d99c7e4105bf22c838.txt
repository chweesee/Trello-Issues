####Steps to reproduce:
- The first gif is with clicking the image in-between toggling, the second gif is without clicking in-between 
- Please note that an image is used in the gif but this also works with regular messages 
- Ensure that "always show spoiler content" is toggled on 
- Send a message as a spoiler 
- Click on the message 
- Change your spoiler setting to "on-click" 
- Observe how the spoiler is now unhidden

####Expected result:
Any clicks should not be registered when set to "always show spoiler content"
####Actual result:
The click is registered and when swapping back the message is spoiled.
