Reported by Throne3d#2479

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a custom server emoji with an underscore in the name (e.g. `:test_this:`) 
- Wrap it in underscores and send a message with it (`_:test_this:_`)

####Expected result:
It should (as with `_:test:_` or the non-custom `_:flag_gb:_`) not break italics â€“ this is noticeable if you put words beside it or use it in a "/me" action
####Actual result:
It breaks the italics of surrounding words and shows the underscores around it, unlike other emoji
####Client settings:
Desktop Canary, 0.0.24
####System settings:
Arch Linux (kernel 4.12.4-1-ARCH), Cinnamon DE (3.4.4-1), Muffin WM (3.4.0-1)

### Can reproduce.
Client Settings: Desktop Stable 0.0.255 38058 System Settings: macOS 10.14.5 Beta (18F127a) -- This bug makes it so that using /me with a custom emote with an underscore in it doesn't work properly, but if this bug still hasn't been fixed at this point the other one could be fixed by simply making /me wrap with asterisks instead
