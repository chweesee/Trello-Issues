**Steps to Reproduce:**
1) try to select some text in a group dm name
2) notice that the window moves with the cursor instead of selecting text
**Expected Result:** selects text
**Actual Result:** window gets dragged

**Client Version:** latest canary as of posting this
**System Settings:**  macOS (i suspect this is a thing with the top of window location and such)

i don't think windows people will be able to reproduce this
