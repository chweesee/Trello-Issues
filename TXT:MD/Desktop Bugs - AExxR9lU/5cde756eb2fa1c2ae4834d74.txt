Reported by Passes-moi la Sot-ci√®re#4779

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open the Activity Feed 
- Disable the material acceleration (if you wish to see the full result) 
- Scroll on the Activity Feed (fast if possible)

####Expected result:
It should be smooth and neither CPU nor GPU intensive. Everything else, including GIFs, is usually ok (less than 3% CPU/GPU)
####Actual result:
The CPU usage gets from 0-2% to around 20-30% (near 100% on one thread) and the frame rates are dropping (or at least it feels laggy) when the material acceleration is turned off. We can notice the same thing on the GPU when it's turned on but I do not lag (older cards may)
####Client settings:
Release Channel: stable, Build Number: 37729, Version Hash: 00a46bd3005673e6f73f92a75547778160088c09
####System settings:
Windows 10 version 1809 (KB4497932) running on an Intel i7-7740X (running at 4.98 GHz)
