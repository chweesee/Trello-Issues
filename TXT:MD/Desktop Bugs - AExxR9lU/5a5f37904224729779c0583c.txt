[Archived] [most likely macOS specific] Discord crashes when joining a call, reloading the client and then interacting with the properties of the “Top Secret Control Panel” in the menu bar. (https://trello.com/c/OxLHrT3e)

P3: Will get fixed eventually,

####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure the control panel icon is visible in the menu bar at the top of your screen. 
- Join a voice channel or call. 
- Without leaving the call press CMD/Ctrl + R 
- Discord should/will now reload and the application will reappear within a couple seconds. 
- When the discord logo starts to spin, click on the “Top Secret Control Panel” dropdown icon. 
- Quickly press “Mute” & “Deafen” a couple times before Discord finishes reloading. 
- Discord should now abort the reload and crash. 
- This may require a couple of attempts as the interaction with the Control Panel (CP) fails sometimes.

####Expected result:
Discord should hide the CP when reloading, as it does when you leave a call/voice channel.
####Actual result:
The CP does not hide, causing it to crash when interacting with it during the reload.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.185 (build 9591)
####System settings:
MacBook Pro (late 2013), macOS Sierra 10.12.1
