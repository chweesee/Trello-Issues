####Steps to reproduce:
- Type a sentence with some words bolded or italicized 
- Double-click and drag to highlight by word. Start from outside of a formatted part and highlight into the part with formatting.

####Expected result:
The highlighted area is expanded entire words at a time
####Actual result:
Once you cross the formatting boundary, the highlight will switch to advancing letters at a time, and will continue to do that even if you leave the formatted text.
