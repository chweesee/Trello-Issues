####Steps to reproduce:
- Find any user with a light avatar (e.g white) and view their -profile 
- Observe that the circle is not smoothly rendered on screen. 
- Note that this problem affects dark avatars, but it's harder to notice since Discord is dark by default

####Expected result:
Circle with avatar is supposed to be clean/smooth.
####Actual result:
You'll see a jagged avatar. Example:
