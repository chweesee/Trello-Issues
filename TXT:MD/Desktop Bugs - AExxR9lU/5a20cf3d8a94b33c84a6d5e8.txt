Reported by Usoka#6021

####Steps to reproduce:
- Set Discord to light theme (User Settings > Appearance > Theme) 
- Find someone who has a mutual server which doesn't have an icon set (just uses the default text) 
- Open up their profile 
- Go to the mutual servers tab 
- Find that server in the list

####Expected result:
Either the background of the icon should be blurple (like it used to), or text should become dark
####Actual result:
white text with no background -> you can't read it
####Client settings:
Desktop Stable build 7842
####System settings:
Windows 10 x64
