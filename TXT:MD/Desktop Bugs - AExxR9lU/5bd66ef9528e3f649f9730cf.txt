####Steps to reproduce:
- 1) Make sure to set your language from English, US (or whatever language) to Korean, should be the last language from the list (User Settings > Language) 
- 2) Click on your friend's profile or if you don't have friends, click on a random person's profile if they are listening to Spotify. 
- 3) You will notice that the "Listen along with [Insert Name Here]" is outside of the modal, but it's not showing as if it is, it's like an invisible overlay or something (can't really describe it in words, there will be an image attached by a Bug Hunter)

####Expected result:
The "Listen along with [Insert Name Here] should be present in the modal and not be stuck out
####Actual result:
The "Listen along with [Insert Name Here]" is not in the modal completely, only part of it
