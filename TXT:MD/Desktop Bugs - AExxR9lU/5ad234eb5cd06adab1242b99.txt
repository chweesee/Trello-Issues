[Archived] After the new guild lazy load, the member list in server settings does not load every member at all, neither can you search for non loaded members (DTesters only currently) (https://trello.com/c/ovi5ycKP)

####Steps to reproduce:
- Be a Trello mod (or have access to member list in server settings) 
- Go to member list and attempt to search/find someone that's not loaded 
- Also observe the counter

####Expected result:
You are supposed to be able to see every member in the member list after x amount time also the counter should show total members in the server
####Actual result:
You can't search non loaded users, and the counter only shows loaded users
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.204 (13602)
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (1709)
