Reported by Cream Cheese Connoisseur#2985

####Steps to reproduce:
- Leave Discord open for about 3 hours without refreshing, I'm not sure how memory leaks work, but it could somehow be related to that
- Open Settings 
- Go to Game Activity 
- Spam Click The Toggle Slide for "Display Currently running game as a status message."

####Expected result:
It should have some sort of debounce to prevent this from happening.
####Actual result:
Discord begins to lag heavily
####Client settings:

### You can get the same result if you change your "Safe Direct Messaging" (first three boxes) settings under user settings > privacy & safety. Can also occur in connections when you toggle the option for Discord to detect other platforms. (Same STR, different menus)
