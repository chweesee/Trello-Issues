Reported by TheForbiddenAi#7549

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to server settings 
- Go to the members tab 
- Click on +(number) at the end of their roles (must have enough roles that it shows the +) 
- In that menu click the plus to add roles 
- Click the x at the top to close server settings 
- Observe how the menu that lists the roles shows for a couple seconds 
- NOTE: If you are quick enough and hit the + button before the menu closes it stays open, however if you remove a role it will work but the role will not be removed from the menu

####Expected result:
The menu should close at the same time the other menus close
####Actual result:
The menu stays open for a couple seconds after the other menus close
####Client settings:

### Cannot reproduce with MacBook Pro 13" (2016) running macOS Mojave 10.14.6 and Canary Build 43372

Moving to Cannot Reproduce list.

Also that would probably be too minor of an issue to dedicate resources fixing it. - Pascal on 2019-08-10T13:51:10.437Z
