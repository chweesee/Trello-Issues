Reported by tntbomb1919#9119

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Click and drag a server icon a tiny bit 
- It will jump up 5 or 6 slots momentarily for about 1 frame then return to its original location (Gif attached is low framerate and is hard to see it happening) 
- If you let go during the frame where it jumps up you will move the server icon up as far as it appears to jump (also in gif) 
- If it doesnt occur anymore try clicking onto another server and then back onto the server you are testing with 

####Expected result:
 It moves normally when you click and drag 
####Actual result:
 The icon appears to jump up momentarily 
####Client version:
 Canary Latest win8.1
