####Steps to reproduce:
- (optional) Zoom discord in 
- Resize the discord window making it narrow 
- Find a message with a media file that is wider than your text view 
- Hover over the message to pop up the tool icons (add reaction etc)

####Expected result:
The media file should shrink down to match the size, or the icons should appear on top.
####Actual result:
The media file stays the same size, escaping the text boundaries of the view, making the icons (and ur sight) fall away.
####Client settings:
Desktop Stable 47539 + Desktop Canary 47580
####System settings:
Window 10 Home 1809
