### This is a P3. - Jared on 2017-10-17T00:37:53.821Z


### I checked this ticket during the Trello Cleanup Event since someone commented that this ticket is a duplication of https://trello.com/c/0YojyjSA/853-pressing-enter-on-modals-does-not-close-them-like-it-used-to. I do agree that it is a duplication of the ticket mentioned as the steps and end result are the same.

Because of this ticket being a duplication, I am archiving it. - Ghoul on 2018-07-06T04:29:18.089Z
