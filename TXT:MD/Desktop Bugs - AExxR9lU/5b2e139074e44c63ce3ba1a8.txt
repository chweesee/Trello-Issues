Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Find an invite embed to a server you're already in 
- If your language is set to English, you should be seeing "JOINED" inside the button 
- Now switch to a different language, in my case French

####Expected result:
I checked Crowdin and there are two strings that say "JOINED". It should be using the one adapted to server invite context.
####Actual result:
It's using the other "JOINED" string, which is used in the context of joined voice channels, causing weird translations like "Connecté" in French meaning  "Connected [to voice channel]".
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.9.9
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
