Reported by GlenMerlin#2119

####Steps to reproduce:
- (You must be in two servers that have custom status) 
- set a status in one server 
- go to another server with custom status and try setting your status 
- notice that it updates the other server when you change it instead of the one your focused on 
- try clearing you status and then change it 
- notice that even though you cleared your status on the first server it will change the status for the first server instead of the one you are focused on

####Expected result:
The status should update for the server you are focused and clearing it should let you change it for the second server
####Actual result:
Status is only updating on the first server
####Client settings:
