####Steps to reproduce:
- get into a video call/screenshare with your best friend! 
- go to a different channel/dm/server to see the video preview 
- put it to any place other than default (top left) 
- hover over it and observe

####Expected result:
The appearing outline should come in evenly, like when the preview is in top left
####Actual result:
The outline comes in late on top and on the right (depending on position), most notably when preview is on right side
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 20386
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro x64
