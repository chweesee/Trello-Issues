####Steps to reproduce:
- Click your own user profile (make sure you are in the full profile modal) (optionally, you can load a game or play something on Spotify)
- Close full modal and observe
Clicking to other profiles does not trigger the banner.

####Expected result:
SMS authenticatior shouldn't look like it's disabled
####Actual result:
The SMS Authentication appears disabled in User Settings and you are asked to enter your password if you choose to enable it though this is only a visual bug (reloading the client fixes the problem/SMS Auth doesn't actually get disabled)
####Client settings:
Discord Canary, Build 10310
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home 64-bit v1709

### I am able to reproduce this very consistently by doing this:
 - Don't have any status (playing/listening etc)
- Reload your client
- Click your own user profile (make sure you are in the full profile modal) (optionally, you can load a game or play something on Spotify)
- Close full modal and observe
Clicking to other profiles does not trigger the banner.

### To clarify: I am not able to reproduce this at all by just waiting, per the original report reproduction steps. However, I can reproduce this every time by following the steps I've outlined in my comment. Thus, I believe going to your own profile is the main reason for the banner reappearing on the client.

### Updated title + repro steps with Sajuuk's steps, because it's easier to repro that way. - Tarek on 2018-04-28T14:26:49.279Z


### As of Canary 0.0.208 (Build 14720), this is no longer reproducible. I clicked to my own full profile and no banner appeared at the top of the client, neither did SMS auth appear "disabled".
