####Steps to reproduce:
- Engage in a video call using the discord app on windows. 
- Don't touch the keyboard or mouse when calling. 
- The laptop will go into sleep mode, every time. 
- It only happens with the windows app. Not with the browser version or on my phone.

####Expected result:
The laptop should recognize the video call as activity without having to give manual input, and not go to sleep mode.
####Actual result:
When using the discord windows app, the laptop doesn't recognize video calls as activity, and goes into sleep mode.
