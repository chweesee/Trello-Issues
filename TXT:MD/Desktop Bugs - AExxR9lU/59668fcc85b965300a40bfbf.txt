### In my experience, the "current date" refers to the date that's underlined with the blue line, if this doesn't correspond to the current date, reload the client

### I can still reproduce this as of 7/28. I would note that Selecting "After:" and then the current date doesn't make any sense and isn't a valid case. However, "before" and "during" totally are. - Jared on 2017-07-28T17:21:38.557Z
