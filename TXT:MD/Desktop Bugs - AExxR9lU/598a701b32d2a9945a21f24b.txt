P3: Will get fixed eventually

Reported by ThatsNoMoon#0175

####Steps to reproduce:
- Join a server with a long channel name, or make one 
- Look at it with a window size that is not as wide as the channel name itself

####Expected result:
The channel name should cut off with "..."
####Actual result:
The channel name does not cut off, and instead continues to to the edge of the Discord window, making it impossible to use the search bar, recent mentions, etc.
####Client settings:
Desktop Stable, 0.0.298
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home Edition, 15063

### This wasn't made apparent in the bug report, however it seems that this is for the channel name at the top of the window, not on the channel list.
