Reported by Hole#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create Category A, and make it a private category, with "Read Text/Voice channels" for @ everyone being disabled. 
- Next, create a channel in that same category. However, on the "Read Channel permission for @ everyone, either put it in the middle or allow it. Then, with another account that has @ everyone permission (default), check the notification settings and find the Category A.

####Expected result:
Notification overrides for Category A isn't supposed to be shown, since it's disabled for everyone.
####Actual result:
You can see the Category A on the Notification Overrides list. (On Android, it's different. You cannot see the category).
