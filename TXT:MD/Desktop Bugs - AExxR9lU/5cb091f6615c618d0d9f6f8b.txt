####Steps to reproduce:
- click on top left tab with server name
- click "server settings" 
- click "members"
- standby until full list loads 
- close out
- doing this repeatedly will cripple discord performance until app is restarted

####Expected result:
Something that should happen, is the member list only affecting a user while within that window
####Actual result:
Performance will stutter, messages will be delayed, and a notable performance halt will occur, effect stacks if repeated

### Can reproduce.
CR Win10 64x (1809), Discord Canary 35473 ~ Tested with 200k Member server. Leaving it will attempt to load ALL users and will destroy the client. So much so once I had completed loading and tried to CTRL + R it forced me to log in again (another bug normally to do with crashing). Discord didn't extremely peak in RAM nor did I run out.

Win10 Pro x64 (1809) | Discord Canary 35540 | Tested on a server with only a few thousand members. Didn't crash discord, but severely lagged it. Was getting like 1 FPS.
