Reported by JOJO#6666

####Steps to reproduce:
- Start a Discord Call on Discord Desktop Client
- Reconnect to the Call via an Android Client (Not sure if this works on iOS)
- The microphone may not be working this may be a separate issue though.
- Try to reconnect to the client via desktop with the disconnected via another client function and it generally will not work, you will have to restart the client generally. I can't remember one time that this has actually worked for me and I'm pretty sure this is a bug.

####Expected result:
You should be able to reconnect to the call without an issue, if you click the button to reconnect, you straight up wont
####Actual result:
You will not reconnect to the call and will have to restart the client.
