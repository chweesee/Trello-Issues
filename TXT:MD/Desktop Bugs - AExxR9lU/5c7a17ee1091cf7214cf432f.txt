P3: Will get fixed eventually

Reported by Forgi_Forgeth#7294

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a server you can manage 
- Click "Upload Image" white button and upload an image that has a much greater width than the height 
- Expect your preview of the icon to be narrow 
- To compare, click on the server icon directly and change it without using the white button on the side 
- Remember to use the same image that is longer than it's height and only observe the previews. 
- Please test the bug and don't call nab immediately 
- Reminder: Do not save the icon because it is the preview bug that we are looking for

####Expected result:
Both methods of uploading a server icon should have the same preview.
####Actual result:
One of the methods (pressing white button that says "Upload Image") shows the preview as a narrow image which shouldn't happen and the other method (clicking directly on server icon to change it) is fine but both methods of changing server icon are messed up in their previews.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.215
####System settings:
