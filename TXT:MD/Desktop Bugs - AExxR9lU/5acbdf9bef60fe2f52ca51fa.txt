### Cannot reproduce. Went through the entire server list in DTesters and saw no "shaking" effect. - Jared on 2018-04-11T21:09:06.603Z

### Still cannot reproduce. The members list is scrolling and occasionally I noticed that it will stutter as it's loading a new chunk of users, but I've still yet to see anything that looks like icons or names are shaking.

Please provide a gif or video if possible. - Jared on 2018-04-23T20:37:11.238Z


### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Canary 14432 - Here's a screenshot for reference https://imgur.com/BhUfeEh.gif

### Can reproduce.
[CR] Windows 10 x64 (1803), Discord Canary 19880. Hold scroll bar and literally shake your mouse up and down in a rhythmic manner so that the members in view barely loads (but hasn't loaded). It took me around 4 minutes repeating the steps to finally reproduce it.
