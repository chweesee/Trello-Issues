### This also happens when the server in the discovery list is at the online cap presence limit. The server outage icon will be shown, and it will load infinitely until you are allowed in. - Ghoul on 2019-03-17T19:51:28.797Z

### Can reproduce.
This also occurs when trying to join a discovery server when banned from the server. There is no error handling for joining discovery servers yet it seems. (Windows Home 10 1909 - Canary Build 61245)
