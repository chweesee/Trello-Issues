####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a server 
- Create some roles (around 6/7) with long names 
- Invite a friend and give him all of those roles 
- Open DM menu (Left click on his profile and Start writing a DM without leaving the server nor sending it) 
- Make him play a song on Spotify (For the bug to work, he need to play a song AFTER you open the menu and write a DM, the game detection need to be empty before opening the menu)

####Expected result:
Nothing. Spotify just appear with the song bar and everything.
####Actual result:
A grey box appear at the down side of Discord. This works with maximised and non-maximised discord.
