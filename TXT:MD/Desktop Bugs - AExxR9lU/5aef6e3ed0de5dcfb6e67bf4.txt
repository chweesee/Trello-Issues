####Steps to reproduce:
- Type 2000 Unicode characters for ☠  
- Send it 
- Try to edit the resulting converted message 
- Optional: ctrl+a the result when editing ctrl+c ctrl+v twice

####Expected result:
Message gets shown in edit mode sent
####Actual result:
Client crashes (related to desktop bug #12003, the resulting character count is around 36399) About Optional: 2000 is enough to crash my client when trying to edit, but probably not enough to crash all clients. Probably caused by trying to calculate if all the :: are emotes
