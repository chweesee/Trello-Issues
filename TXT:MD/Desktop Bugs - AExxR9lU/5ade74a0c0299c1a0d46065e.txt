### Can reproduce.
Can Reproduce; iPhone 8 +, iOS 11.4 - Discord TestFlight 2.3.0 (3817). — When Discord Feedback was on an outage, I attempted to open my Recent Mentions and saw my screen going black as if my client is about to crash. But my client never finishes crashing as the application is non-responsive and you have to force close it. That’s how it was on iOS.

### As a small note, this is a cross platform bug. Happening on Android, iOS and Desktop.

And not directly related to the outage that happened yesterday, this happens on any outage. Since I tested this in my server and put it on outage and could still repro. - Tarek on 2018-04-24T14:09:41.091Z
