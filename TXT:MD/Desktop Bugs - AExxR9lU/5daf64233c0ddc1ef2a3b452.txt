####Steps to reproduce:
- scroll to the bottom of your server list (you need enough servers to scroll) 
- create a server folder here by dragging a few servers on top of eachother 
- expand the server folder 
- note how it expands upwards now 
- hover over the server folder 
- collapse the server folder without moving the mouse 
- note how the small white bar to the left of the server folder stays there until hovered over

####Expected result:
the small white bar to the left of the server folder appears as if it's being hovered over
####Actual result:
the small white bar should not appear
