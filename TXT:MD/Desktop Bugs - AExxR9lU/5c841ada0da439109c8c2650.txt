####Steps to reproduce:Go to to server's server settings by right clicking on the server icon and clicking "Server Settings" 
- Click delete server and enter the server's name 
- Click "Delete Server" 
- Quickly go to your side bar (left) and right click on the server icon before it disappears 
- Click "Server Settings"

####Expected result:
You shouldn't be able to access the popup menu when a server is being deleted, so you won't access the server settings.
####Actual result:
You are able to click any of the options in the popup menu, which usually brings you to a blank screen.
####Client settings:
Canary Build 33683
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home

### Can't reproduce.
After deleting the server, the icon vanishes quicker than I can click, even if my mouse is pre-hovering over it in the delete screen.
