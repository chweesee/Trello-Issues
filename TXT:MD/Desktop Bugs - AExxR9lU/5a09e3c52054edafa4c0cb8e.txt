### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Home x64, Canary 0.0.176 (7256) This actually happens on every link you middle click. As seen on the attached GIF, if you middle click a link, a new instance of Discord Canary opens in the background.

### Middle clicking in Chrome opens a new tab. This may just be an Electron issue not handling the middle click correctly, which wouldn't be a Discord bug.
