Reported by Dru#8209

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Have someone talk or read you a nice story or something without stopping (still easy to repro with a music bot) 
- Deafen yourself 

####Expected result:
 It deafens you seamlessly 
####Actual result:
 it makes a sort of double blip in the audio before deafening you (May be related to the other bug I reported regarding muting yourself)
