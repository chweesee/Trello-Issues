### Can reproduce.
Can Reproduce - Canary, Build Number: 17800, Windows 10 x64 v1709 - For me, I saw the bubble appear, only if the person was speaking when you join the call, and when they stop, it remains. Seems more like the bug is that the "bubble" gets stuck in whatever state that it was in when the user joined the call.

### Can reproduce.
CR Windows 10 pro x64 Canary Build: 17800, you have to tab in and out between servers and the voice call for the green circle to even update properly, it does get stuck depending on who's talking when you are in another server and tab back into the DM voice call
