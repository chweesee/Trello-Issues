Server does not display white blocks even when new messages are sent in the now unmuted channel.
####Client settings:
Discord TestFlight iOS 2.0.1 (1610)
####System settings:
iPhone 8 +, iOS 11.1.1 (but seems to occur on other OS‚Äôs, so all is free to try it.)

### Appears to be happening in iOS and Linux as far that I am concerned. There is something more in depth about this bug about the notification (as if it was acting like it‚Äôs muted but it‚Äôs not. ) I will continue to look into this bug and will send more information when applicable.

### So, it appears that Windows is able to reproduce now... per Tiger Gaming. However, there is more further in depth for this bug. If you go into Notification Settings in channel, you will find the result from this screenshot which seems to be causing the bug in the first place. I believe it might be more safe to say that it may be a hit and miss with all OS‚Äôs/platforms. (As far I am aware, iOS, Windows, and Linux can reproduce.)
