Reported by SuperSajuuk#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Enable compact mode. 
- Find a user with an invisible username and no nickname. 
- Try to click the area where their username would be shown.

####Expected result:
Although invisible, the profile modal opens normally.
####Actual result:
You cannot open their profile, which means you need to mention them to get the profile modal open.
####Client settings:
Canary 0.0.211 (Build 19451)
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro (64-bit), Creators Update (v1709, Build 16299.371)
