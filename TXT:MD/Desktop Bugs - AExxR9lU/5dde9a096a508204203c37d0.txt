Reported by Anatolia#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- First, create a group with the user. 
- Make a group call. (Two users must join the voice call.) 
- After joining the voice call in the group, call from the profile of the user joining the group call without ending the group call. 
- Even if the user you are calling from the profile does not join the call, it will appear connected to the call.

####Expected result:
Although it has not joined the call, it should not show connected.
####Actual result:
Even if the user you are calling from the profile does not connect the call, it will appear connected to the call.
