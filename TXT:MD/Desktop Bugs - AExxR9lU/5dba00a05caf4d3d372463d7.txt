####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a hidden voice channel 
- Join the hidden voice channel and go live 
- Drag a user who does not have permission to see the voice channel into the hidden channel with you 
- The user will not see you live and cannot join the stream

####Expected result:
The other user should be able to see you go live and join the stream in hidden voice channels they cannot see.
####Actual result:
The other user cannot see you go live and thus cannot join the stream in the hidden voice channel.

### Can reproduce.
This seems to be a backend issue. Might it be because when RTC establishes a connection, it double checks permissions for the voice channel? MacBook Pro: macOS Catalina 10.15.2; Discord Canary 52491 & iPhone 7: iOS 13.3; TestFlight 3.1.9 (18591)

### You also cannot watch a stream if the capacity of the voice channel is full or overfull.
