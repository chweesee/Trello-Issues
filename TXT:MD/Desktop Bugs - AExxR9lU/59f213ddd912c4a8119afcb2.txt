Reported by Evie.Codes#4611

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to any sufficiently large server (largest = happens more) 
- Hover over any user. Move the mouse around to see a constant flicker effect

####Expected result:
The hover (grey background) stays there as long as the use list doesn't visually move.
####Actual result:
Updates in the member list removes the "selection" of the user. Moving the mouse around causes a flicker.
####Client settings:
Canary Web on Chrome
####System settings:
Windows 10, Chrome 61.0.3163.100
