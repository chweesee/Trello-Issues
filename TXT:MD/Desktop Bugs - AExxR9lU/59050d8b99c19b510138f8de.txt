Reported by eslachance#4611

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Attempt to ping a user, in this instance `@Maxwell#7793`  
- User Maxwell leaves server 
- Send message after user has left 

####Expected result:
 `@Maxwell#7793` should appear as plain text (as if the user was invisible for example) 
####Actual result:
 Another *completely different user*, in this case `@max#2476` , is mentionned instead. This can be *very* bad when it's in a command to ban a user. 
####System settings:
 Canary 10 latest on Windows 10 Creator update.

### Important note: for this to work, there must be a user of which the username consitutes the *beginning* of the other user's username. For example here `max` is the beginning of `maxwell`. `eslach` would be pinged instead of `eslachance`. `b1n` could be pinged instead of `b1nzy`, so on and so forth.

### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Pro x64. This has been an issue for a long time, even happens with invisible users. Discord's mentioning system is too eager to mention whoever it wants, and it's a real pain, especially when you work with bots to ban users.

### Happens 100% if you try to mention an invisible or offline user, midst there is of course another user starting with a first part of the user you want to mention.
