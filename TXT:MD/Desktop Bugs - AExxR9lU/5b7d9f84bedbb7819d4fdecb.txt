####Steps to reproduce:
- Join a voice channel and have a bot join the voice channel and start playing audio 
- Have the bot join a voice channel in a different server that you share with it 
- Have the bot leave the voice channel in the other server

####Expected result:
The bot continues playing audio and the green circular outline indicator remains unchanged
####Actual result:
The bot continues playing audio, but the indicator stops showing. The indicator reappears if the bot stops playing audio and then starts again.
####Client settings:
Desktop Canary Build 22333
