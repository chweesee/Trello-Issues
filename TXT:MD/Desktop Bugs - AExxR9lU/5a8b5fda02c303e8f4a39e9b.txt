####Steps to reproduce:
- Ensure overlay is enabled on discord and for the game Planetside 2. (It is a verified entry) 
- Upon starting the game the overlay will show its enabled. 
- Attempt to use ingame keyboard inputs, and find they are not responsive 
- If overlay is disabled and discord is running keyboard input works normally.

####Expected result:
Once loaded into the game keyboard commands should work, (WASD movement, ESC menu button, other keyboard shortcuts in the game)
####Actual result:
All keyboard input is ignored in the game, Alt+Tab and Ctrl+Alt+Delete is your only way out.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary Build: 10557
####System settings:

### This isn't a bug that's related to Planetside 2. The same thing is happen in minecraft and we're looking to fix it. The overlay isn't rendering. This never should have gone through as it's own bug, there are existing overlay tickets it should have been added to. - Jared on 2018-02-20T20:59:43.110Z
