Reported by Daffyduck#5364

####Steps to reproduce:
- Be in a call with someone. 
- Go to a server channel and send a message 
- Go back to the DM call and don't move your mouse for a second or two 
- After that second or two, go ahead and move your mouse upwards towards the Home button. 
- Observe the merging of the home button and DM. 
- Try this more then once. 
- Note: This does not happen on Stable as it might be related to Electron 5.

####Expected result:
It should take you back to the DM without any merging happening.
####Actual result:
The Home button merges with the DM causing your server list to "Jump"
####Client settings:
Discord Canary Host 0.0.235, Build 36426
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64 v1809
