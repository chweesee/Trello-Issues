Reported by Bear#5153

####Steps to reproduce:-Add a new camera to the system I'm using an EK7000 Pro -Switch the camera into PC Camera Mode -Open discord and navigate to the video test page under settings -Select iCatch (the external camera)for your setup from the drop down 
- Disconnect the External camera 
- Reconnect it

####Expected result:
Upon reconnection the camera should be selectable from the drop down and video should switch to it.
####Actual result:
When the camera is reconnected discord will not switch from the internal camera even if it is not selected until closed
####Client settings:
Release Channel: Stable, Build Number 30302
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro 1803 OS Build 17134.472 Bootcamp while this is not part of the template, this was resubmitted per moderator instructions and the internal microphone is soldered to the system. The external camera has no problems.
