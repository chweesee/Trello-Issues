Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Search for a message, or open recent mentions in the current server. 
- Pick any old message and click "Jump" 
- After you have successfully jumped, click "Jump to present" to return to recent messages 
- Open Settings and then switch to any other language 
- Wait for Discord to reload and look at the chat

####Expected result:
You should be placed at the recent messages in the channel you were in
####Actual result:
You are still jumped to the old message you selected previously, like if it didn't remember that you clicked "Jump to present".
####Client settings:
Discord Canary build 6420
####System settings:
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Asus Netbook F551C, Intel Core i3 64bits
