Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Edit a channel and set a channel topic as one word wrapped between single asterisks 
- Observe the channel topic in the header. No italics 
- Now clickto expand the channel topic. Italics work there

####Expected result:
Italics should render in both header and expanded version
####Actual result:
Text shows italics in expanded topic but not in header. Happens with bold as well.
####Client settings:
