####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a server that gets join messages 
- Have someone join the server 
- add roles to the user 
- look at the user's usercard from the join message

####Expected result:
The usercard should show the roles section, along with all of the user's roles.
####Actual result:
The usercard shows up, omitting the roles section
