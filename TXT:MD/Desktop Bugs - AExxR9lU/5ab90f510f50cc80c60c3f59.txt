### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 Pro 1709 x64, Canary Build 12608; It's still happening after you closed the game and it also occurs when you disable the overlay in the games tab (While still ingame, it only happens when disabling the overlay for the specific game. After you quit the game, it happens with all of them); With Stable Build 12477 it's still working like it should tho

### Still cannot reproduce. When I  toggle the overlay OFF in user settings while the overlay is open in-game, the overlay disappears. - Jared on 2018-04-23T20:08:40.153Z
