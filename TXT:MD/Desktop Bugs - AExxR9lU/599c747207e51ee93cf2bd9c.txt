####Steps to reproduce:
- Fill in Discord Nitro signup form up to the point where a ZIP code has to be entered.

####Expected result:
The grey placeholder text "zip" for the zipcode is shown before entering any characters in the zip field, like the behaviour of the other placeholder fields (Credit Card Number, MM/YY, CVV).
####Actual result:
The "zip" placeholder disappears before entering the first character in the zip field, after entering the card's CVV code).
####Client settings:
Discord Canary, 0.0.163
