Reported by kadybat#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a code block using the tab key as a separator between two pieces of text (copy this in from an external source, IE a programming tool) 
- Post it 
- Attempt to copy and paste it from Discord into another app (IE said programming tool)

####Expected result:
Discord should recognize the tabs as separators and maintain them in copied text
####Actual result:
Discord changes the tabs to spaces, and the code pastes into an external app with spaces rather than tabs
####Client settings:
Stable 23017
####System settings:
macOS 10.3.6, MacBookPro 14,3

### Can reproduce.
Intended? Like, Discord text input does not support tab, but you 'forced' to input text with tabs, making Discord converts to spaces. Windows 10 x64 1803 (17134), Discord Canary with Build number 23321
