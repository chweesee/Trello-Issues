### Can't reproduce.
macOS High Sierra, Version: 10.13.6 - Canary 0.0.216; I do not have nitro which means that I don't have much access to the games, I attempted doing this with Warframe since it is the only game in my library and I could not get the bug to be reproduce, this may be because I do not have nitro.
