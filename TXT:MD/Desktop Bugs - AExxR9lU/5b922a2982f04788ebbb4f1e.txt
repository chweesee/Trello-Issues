####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a server where you have Manage Server, and Manage Channels. 
- Create a voice channel on that server on a mobile device of choice. 
- On desktop, open the server settings panel for the server. 
- In the AFK Channel settings, select the voice channel you just created. DO NOT SAVE YET! 
- On the mobile device, delete the channel you selected. 
- The dropdown on desktop will now say "Select...". 
- Open Dev Tools. (ctrl+shift+i, or cmd+alt+i) 
- Open the network tab in devtools. 
- Click save changes. 
- Observe how the request made succeeds with code 200.

####Expected result:
The save should be successful and allow you to exit the server settings panel.
####Actual result:
The unsaved changes bar doesn't disappear despite the PATCH request being successful.
