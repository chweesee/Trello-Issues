Reported by Ene#0808

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go into a server with enough messages to scroll up so that you're viewing older ones 
- Scroll up and then have someone else send a new message 
- Scroll down until you reach the point where it loads new messages and observe the unread banner disappearing

####Expected result:
Scrolling down while viewing older messages should not be marking the channel as read
####Actual result:
Scrolling down will keep marking the channel as read every time it loads in new messages, even occasionally continuously marking the channel as read while you're not even scrolling
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.211, Build 22665
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home 64-bit (v1709)
