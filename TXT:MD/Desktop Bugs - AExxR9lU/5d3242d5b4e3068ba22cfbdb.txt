Reported by Cheez#4519

####Steps to reproduce:
- Amp off (I have a Fiio K3) 
- Boot PC 
- Discord opens on boot 
- Turn amp on 
- Connect to server 
- No audio output.

####Expected result:
There should be audio out when you connect to a server. (Connecting to the server still makes a noise)
####Actual result:
The amp is visible in settings, but there is no sound- you can use mic check to test.
####Client settings:
stable, Build Number: 40044
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home 10.0.17763 Build 17763
