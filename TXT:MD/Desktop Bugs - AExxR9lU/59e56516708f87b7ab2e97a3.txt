Reported by Pascal#0929

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have `Explicit Content Filter` activated (members without role or all members option) 
- Go to `Server settings` -> `Moderation` 
- Observe how `Explicit Content Filter` changed

####Expected result:
`Explicit Content Filter` shouldn't change automatically to nothing.
####Actual result:
It changes automatically. Might be an issue that happens after some extended period time. There is nothing about it in the audit log. Note: I was also unable to change the filter from nothing to all members (must change it to members without roles first).
####Client settings:
Discord Canary, 0.0.155, Build 5843
####System settings:
MacBook Pro 13" (2016), macOS High Sierra 10.13
