####Steps to reproduce:
- Click and drag a text channel 
- Drag it under Voice Channels

####Expected result:
The Voice Channel dims, similar if you tried vice versa
####Actual result:
A green bar appears under Voice Channels, giving you the option to drop it. When you drop it, it instead brings it up to the top of Text Channels <http://imgur.com/Hdlh6Oe>
####Client settings:
Desktop Canary 0.0.163
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64

I can no longer reproduce this myself. Dragging a text channel in a category that only has voice channels seems to work just fine for me now. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-09-22T15:14:52.929Z
