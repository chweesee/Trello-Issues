Reported by Isabel#0002

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a crap ton of mentions in your Recent Mentions. Enough where you can scroll down and see "Load More Messages." 
- Dismiss all mentions by clicking the x in the top right of the message.

####Expected result:
The "more messages" should load.
####Actual result:
The "more messages" only load once you've exited and re-entered the modal. In the meantime, the modal displays "And in the beginning... there was silence."
####Client settings:
Canary 31785
####System settings:
MacBook Pro (13", Mid-2012), macOS v10.14.2 (Mojave)
