####Steps to reproduce:Make a voice call to a friend. But your friend is not supposed to take the call. 
- Stay on call for 2 minutes. (don't leave the voice call) 
- Now press the small Settings button on the call and scroll down and press the "Reset Voice Settings" button. 
- Observe without leaving call for 5 minutes.

####Expected result:
Because there was only one person on call, call had to be automatically closed after 5 minutes.
####Actual result:
If the voice settings are reset after 2 minutes, the timeout period of 5 minutes is reset, even though the call is on its own.
####Client settings:
Discord 50980 - Microsoft Edge 44.19030.1.0
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home
