### Tested on latest canary as of writing:

I can no longer reproduce this. Tested this with my main and alt account. Right-click sending them an invite immediately sent the link in a DM to my alt account without me ever having to go into my own main acc DMs first. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-04-25T01:02:49.446Z
