####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a text channel that has a channel topic. 
- Open a game modal (e.g. Minecraft) from a user activity. 
- Make sure to have friends playing this game. 
- Click one of these friends, and then click one of their mutual friends. You don't need to open their game modal too (like I do in the GIF). 
- Close all open modals, and now repeatedly open and close the channel topic a few times by clicking at the same spot.

####Expected result:
The game modal you visited first should not re-appear when clicking in the channel topic.
####Actual result:
The game modal you visited first does re-appear when clicking the channel topic.

### Can reproduce.
Discord Canary 0.0.232, Build 32982, Windows 10 Home 64-bit (v1803) | I cannot reproduce with the steps listed, but I can quite frequently by following these:
- Find someone playing a game that has a preview card and open their profile
- Click on the game icon to open the preview card
- Click on the user's icon from the "Now playing" section to open their profile again
- Open the game's preview card once again and then close everything with the ESC key
- Now go into a server you have Manage Server permission in and open the Server Region modal in Server Settings -> Overview
- Press the ESC key twice to close the Server Region modal and Server Settings panel and quite frequently the game preview card will reappear (so give it a few attempts if you can't reproduce)
