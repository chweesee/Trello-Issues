### This is actually a really weird bug. Searching for "theoblivinator" or "twitch" works, but "twitch.tv" doesn't.  But, Verified. - Jared on 2017-01-05T21:06:05.310Z

### Tested on latest canary as of writing:

I can reproduce this only when the link I'm searching doesn't have `www.` appended to it. Searching for those works just fine with `www.twitch.tv`.

Although it's not wrong to assume that using partial link names like `twitch.tv` should also resolve to `www.twitch.tv` search-wise which is probably where the bug comes from. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-04-25T11:21:46.678Z
