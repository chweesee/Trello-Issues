### Could be related to https://trello.com/c/1uBtXykh however, this is done by closing and reopening Discord not Windows Explorer.

### This is different from https://trello.com/c/1uBtXykh/1518-when-we-restart-windows-explorer-the-red-and-white-dot-on-the-canary-logo-dissapear because this ticket does not require killing the process through the task manager, rather through our client. - Jared on 2018-03-05T21:17:11.793Z
