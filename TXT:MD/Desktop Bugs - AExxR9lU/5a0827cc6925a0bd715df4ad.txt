### Can reproduce.
Could reproduce on the second try. I didn't need to "slow down" my connection to achieve the actual result. Tip to easily reproduce: hold Ctrl all the time and as soon as you see the "Connecting" screen hit R. Windows 10 Pro x64 (Version 1709), Discord Canary (Build 7194) and Stable (Build 7157).
