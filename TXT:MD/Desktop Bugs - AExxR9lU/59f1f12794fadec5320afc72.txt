### The key under Settings -> Voice & Video doesn't work. But if i set a key for push to talk under Settings -> Keybinds it works

### I can actually still reproduce this, Canary Build 8121 on 0.0.181 (W10, 1607)

PTT doesn't work at all by following these steps:

 - Go to user settings
 - Go to Voice & Video 
 - Switch input mode to "Push to Talk"
 - Then add a shortcut key in the same setting menu

Moving to user reported for verification.  - Tarek on 2017-12-06T18:42:16.588Z
