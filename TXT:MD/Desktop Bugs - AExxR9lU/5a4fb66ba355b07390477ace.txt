####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a webhook with a set name (eg: Webhook A). 
- Make the webhook post a few times in the channel. 
- Change the name of the webhook to something else (eg Webhook B). 
- Make sure the old posts are pushed out of sight (so they're not loaded within the first 50). 
- Make the webhook post with the new name. 
- Change to another server, then reload the client so your cache is empty. 
- Click profile for your webhook's new name and observe name. 
- Scroll up chat history so the old name and new name of the same webhook are loaded in your client. 
- Click profile for your webhook's new name with the old ones loaded and observe.

####Expected result:
Like with users, the latest name/metadata would be shown in the pop-out of the recent posts.
####Actual result:
The old name gets used on the more recent posts that uses the newer name all the time.
####Client settings:
Desktop Canary 0.0.194 (Build 9258)
####System settings:
Windows 10 Pro (64-bit), Anniversary Update (Build 1607)
