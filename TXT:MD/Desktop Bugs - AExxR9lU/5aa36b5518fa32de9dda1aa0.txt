### I can still reproduce this on Canary 11885 by following an another way provided by Ene#0808
Reopening ticket

- Server settings 
- Members 
- Right click on a user to get context menu
- Then use escape to close it down. What happens is that Discord minimizes 

Edit:

Seems like like it's 100% reproduce able when you use escape when a context menu is shown everywhere, (in chat, member list, channel menu etc) - Tarek on 2018-03-11T09:27:30.009Z
