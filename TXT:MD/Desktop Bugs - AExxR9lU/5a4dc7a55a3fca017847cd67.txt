Reported by !Surg#4149

####Steps to reproduce:
- Set a mute keybind to Ctrl+p(any key works) 
- Set a Deafen keybind to Ctrl+Shift+p 
- Enter any voice channel 
- Use Ctrl+p to mute (or don't) -Then use Ctrl+Shift+p to deafen 
- Use it again to undeafen

####Expected result:
You undeafen and still are muted (or if you didn't mute first, you are unmuted)
####Actual result:
You quickly get undeafened and deafened again. You must use your Mute keybind to undeafen.(Some times it will work correctly depending on the timing of pressing keys...)
