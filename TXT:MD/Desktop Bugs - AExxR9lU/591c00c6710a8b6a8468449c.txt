### This seems to be happening even on supported window sizes if zoomed in. The issue is that a scrollbar doesn't appear like it should such as on other modals like Profile, Notification Settings, etc.

### Caused by reason textbox pushing button out on those screens with low screen height. A temp workaround is to use Canary's "zoom level" to zoom out and make the button appear, but I believe this is a known issue anyway.
