### Ok so I thought this was the issue where "open in browser" spanned the full width of the expanded image.  This is in fact about the bottom 1-2px under the image still in its embed form.  I'll fix that also. - Shadi Isber on 2017-04-25T16:28:42.725Z

### Checked on canary build 7256:

I can no longer reproduce this myself. Clicking the bottom-most few pixels of an image no longer immediately opens it in the browser. Rigorously checked this myself. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-11-13T15:11:54.628Z
