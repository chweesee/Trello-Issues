Reported by Zeta#7000

####Steps to reproduce:
 - Have a private or hidden voice channel with people in it. 
 - find someone you think that's in the hidden voice channel in the member list, and then proceed to click their name. If they're connected to the VC, a "Server Mute" and "Server Deafen" will show up under their name upon clicking them.

####Expected result:
You are not supposed to find out if a user is connected in a hidden voice channel. Also, Mute/Deafen should not show up.
####Actual result:
You are able to find people that are connected to a hidden voice channel you don't have permission to see.
####Client settings:
Version 2.3.0
####System settings:
