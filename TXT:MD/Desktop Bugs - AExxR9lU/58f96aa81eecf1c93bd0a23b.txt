Reported by Immotay#2748

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Upload a picture smaller than 128Â² (I did it with 16x16 icons) 
- Click either Save Changes or Reset 

####Expected result:
 if you click Save, it should display an error as the image is smaller than it should. If you click reset it should revert back to the old picture 
####Actual result:
 When clicking Save nothing changes. And when clicking Reset it doesnt change your picture back to the old one, leaving you with a low res server icon. 
####System settings:
 Windows 10 x64 & Canary

### The save changes no longer saves them. If you don't press reset you can't get out of the settings screen even if the picture is of the correct size

### This isn't a bug, it's bad messaging.  We don't mean "the smallest image you can upload is 128x128", we mean that any image smaller than that is going to be upscaled to 128x128. NAB. - Jared on 2017-04-21T17:32:24.619Z
