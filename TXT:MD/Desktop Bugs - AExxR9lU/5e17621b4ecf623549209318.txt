####Steps to reproduce:
- Put a bunch of random numbers and names on the credit card and address page 
- Click next 
- Observe that NEXT has been clicked, but nothing happens 
- Manually hit BACK 
- Notice the invalid credit card notice

It should automatically move back to the card page with the alert

It does not move (and you get confused)
