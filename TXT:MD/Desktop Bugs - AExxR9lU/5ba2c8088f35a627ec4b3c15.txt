####Steps to reproduce:Make sure you have the most up to date update to Discord Canary 
- Press your cogwheel and click your profile image to change it 
- try to change it with any other image.

####Expected result:
The image should change to the image you opened, aka your profile picture should be updated.
####Actual result:
Nothing at all. It stays on whatever it was previously. Even removing all images before adding a new one doesn't work.
