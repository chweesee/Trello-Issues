####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to the StreamKit Overlay config page ( https://streamkit.discordapp.com/overlay ) 
- Ensure your downloaded Discord Client is running 
- Hit either of the install buttons (you won't actually be installing anything, just connecting to the client) 
- Configure the server and channel fields in all 3 widget configuration menus 
- Return to the chat widget screen

####Expected result:
The widget should work correctly and the URL should only contain fields meant for the widget selected
####Actual result:
Notice that the URL provided is filled with flags meant for other widgets, and that the chat widget preview nor the actual URL provided actually work
####Client settings:
Web Stable - Chrome Stable x64 60.0.3112.101
####System settings:
Win 10 Pro x64 v1607
