####Steps to reproduce:
- Have atleast one connection visible in your profile(In Settings) 
- Click on your profile 
- Give yourself a note 
- Triple click your name and discriminators 
- See how it also highlights your note.

####Expected result:
It should only highlight your name and number,**like it does when you don't have a connection visible on your profile**
####Actual result:
Triple clicking your name also highlights your note.
