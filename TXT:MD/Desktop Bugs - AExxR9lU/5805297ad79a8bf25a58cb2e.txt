**Steps to Reproduce:**
1) Maximise the window to full size (or even enlarge it to any size you wish)
2) Minimise the window to taskbar
3) Wait for a notification or just click the tray icon.
**Expected Result:** The app will reappear in the previous state that it was minimised in.
**Actual Result**: The app reappears in the default window size.

**Client Version:** Canary latest version, but happens in every build
**System Settings:**  Windows 10 x64.
**Notes:** Has been happening for a while and hasn't been fixed, but reposting for it to be moved to the Trello
