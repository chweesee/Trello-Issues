Reported by Rashaun#9295

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a new server so you can see the "Welcome to your server" list in the default channel and close the member list 
- Once you close the member list, unmaximise Discord and adjust the window size to the smallest window possible width-wise 
- Observe the "Welcome to your server" list with the member list closed and then open the member list and observe the list again

####Expected result:
The server guide should be fully visible and not cut off
####Actual result:
The server guide is cut off on both sides
