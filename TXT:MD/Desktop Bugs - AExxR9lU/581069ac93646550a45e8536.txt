### Here's what's happening: the very top of discord is actually an un-interactable bar.  It's how your computer knows when you're trying to reposition the app, vs just using it normally.

The server icon is "under-lapping" this invisible bar, so when you click on it, nothing happens because you're not actually clicking it, you're clicking on the invisible bar.  Clicking on the bottom portion works because they're lower than the invisible bar.

Unfortunately, this is a Won't Fix because it would take a massive redesign to work around it and not have it look like shit. - Jared on 2016-10-28T17:59:14.163Z
