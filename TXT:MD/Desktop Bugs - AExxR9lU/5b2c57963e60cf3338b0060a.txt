####Steps to reproduce:
- Switch to Light Theme if not already using 
- Open your User Settings and go into your Connections 
- Link something if you don't already have anything 
- Observe the "Display" text in the panel of your linked connection (most noticeable with Twitch)

####Expected result:
"Display" text is white so that is it completely visible
####Actual result:
"Display" text is grey making it very hard to read
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.211, Build 17486
####System settings:
