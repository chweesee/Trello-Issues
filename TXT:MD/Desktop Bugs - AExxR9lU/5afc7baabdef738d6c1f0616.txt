####Steps to reproduce:
- Step 1 Have nine members on a group chat.  
- Step 2 Have perfect timing with a friend. 
- Step 3 Invite someone to the group chat at the same time.

####Expected result:
You'll have 11 members or more if done with way more people.
####Actual result:
You'll have 11 people, once you kick one will remain 10 and you can't add anyone else.
####Client settings:
Not server DMs, everyone can add me, voice activity, overlay on, desktop and notifications sound disabled, TTS off and automated emote-to-emoji off.
####System settings:
Windows 10, 1709 Falls Creator Update

### I found different steps which seem easier to; make a groupchat with just you and your alt - on main account select 8 people to add (dont add them yet) - on alt add one person - on main add the 8 selected people
