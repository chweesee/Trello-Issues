####Steps to reproduce:
- Set your Zoom Level to anything lower than 90
- Move your cursor to the right side of chat just before the scrollbar
- Middle click on your mouse and move your cursor up

####Expected result:
Chat should move up so you could read earlier messages
####Actual result:
Chat stays in the same place and instead scrolls through the member list
