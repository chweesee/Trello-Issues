####Steps to reproduce:Dev mode off 
- Go to a server check a channel where you can read messages 
- Hover a message from other user that has reactions 
- If you can see the 3 dots menu, click it, and try to disable everything else than the Reactions option; if you only see the Reactions option, then it's probably no repro 
- Also you should not have any manage message permissions

####Expected result:
The 3-dots menu on a message from another user should appear so that I can see who reacted
####Actual result:
The 3-dots menu doesn't show up, and I can't see who reacted to the message

### Can reproduce.
CN, 3 "reactions" option doesnt trigger a 3 dot menu by itself even tough it needs to. To repro make sure you dont have "manage messages" and disable dev mode Browser Stable 28017, Google Chrome 70.0.3538.102 (Official Build) (64-bit) (cohort: Stable), Windows 10 [Version 10.0.17134.407]
