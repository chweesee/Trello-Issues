####Steps to reproduce:
- Put Discord Canary into fullscreen mode (On macOS) 
- Watch a YouTube video in fullscreen mode that's been embedded 
- Try to exit fullscreen mode, only works by restarting client

####Expected result:
It should allow you to exit fullscreen mode using the following: Escape, pressing "f", double clicking the screen
####Actual result:
You can't exit YouTube's fullscreen mode, the only way to do so is to reload the entire client
