### I can still reproduce this on Canary 17036 by using Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (1803).

Instead of using (ctrl +) hit the cog button to access user settings then use escape quite fast a few times and you'll notice the bug.

Reopening ticket & repro steps has been edited slightly. This is also affecting DM calls getting stuck - Tarek on 2018-06-15T22:39:10.906Z
