Reported by Marc#5983

####Steps to reproduce:
- set the text size to 150 (Easily visible) 
- head on to a server where you can invite people 
- press the invite people button (dropdown menu of a server)

####Expected result:
all the text resizes, not just the names of people
####Actual result:
Only the names of users are resized, everything else ("invite friends", "copy", "invite") dont rescale.
