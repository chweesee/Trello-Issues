####Steps to reproduce:
- Send a message containing some substring foo you wish to replace, which must end in a backslash 
- Send the substitution message ('s/foo/bar', where bar is the string you wish to substitute in for foo)

####Expected result:
foo is replaced with bar, no message is sent to the channel
####Actual result:
The substitution message is sent to channel, the message is not edited
####Client settings:
Discord Stable, Build 13856
####System settings:
