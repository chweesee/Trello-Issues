####Steps to reproduce:
- Have "Game Activity" enabled in settings 
- Be playing Minecraft (windowed, not fullscreen) 
- Go into a DM and begin a call  
- Click screenshare  
- It asks you if you want to screenshare a window, and it will also suggest Minecraft since it knows youre playing it 
- Select to share Minecraft

####Expected result:
The game begins casting to the call
####Actual result:
The video freezes. On your end it is stuck on whatever was visible when you clicked the game, and its just black on everyone elses screen
####Client settings:
Canary 31115
####System settings:
