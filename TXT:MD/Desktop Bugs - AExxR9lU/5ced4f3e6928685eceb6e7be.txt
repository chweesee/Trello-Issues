Reported by Talon#1337

####Steps to reproduce:
- This usually works in Discord Testers so I would recommend trying it here. 
- Scroll to the bottom of the channel list. 
- The Bug Hunter general-chat is very active so wait for someone to send a message. 
- Scroll very fast, like super fast up the channel list. (all the way to the top) 
- Observe where the unread message indicator is for a split second.

####Expected result:
The unread message indicator is supposed to stay under `#bug-hunter-general-chat`.
####Actual result:
The unread message indicator goes above the `#bug-hunter-general-chat`, on the banner.
####Client settings:
Discord client: 38248 (canary)W
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home with a 64 bit processor.
