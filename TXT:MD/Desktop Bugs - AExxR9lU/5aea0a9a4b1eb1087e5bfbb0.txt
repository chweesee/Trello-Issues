### I can reproduce this bug, but it's in a slightly different way as shown here: https://i.imgur.com/lFCPAvi.png It is best reproduced by doing: - View someone who is playing a game / streaming / listening to Spotify's profile - Observe. It should look like a normal Nitro badge, but it looks like someone took a scissor and cut it into pieces. -w 14558

### Quick note: I can't reproduce this on build 14965. Not by using the steps to reproduce or Ghoul's steps.

Won't move it about as it's not a verified bug, but just noticing it. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2018-05-10T14:37:46.111Z
