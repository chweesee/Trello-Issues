####Steps to reproduce:
- Possibly windows only? 
- Open your friends list 
- Hover over the top part of one of the buttons at the top that isn't selected, ensuring that your cursor isn't directly over the text, but the hover effect appears (i.e. All, Online, Pending, Blocked)

####Expected result:
The entire hover effect should be a clickable button
####Actual result:
It appears as if you're hovering over a clickable button, but clicking doesn't actually do anything
####Client settings:
Desktop Canary 0.0.163 (Build 1609)
####System settings:
Win 10 Pro x64 v1607

### This is because that's where the hidden window header is. You can click and drag there to move the window.
