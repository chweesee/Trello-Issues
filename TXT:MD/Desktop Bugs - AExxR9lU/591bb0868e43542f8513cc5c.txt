### Doesn't require you to be in streamer mode before making the invite

### This bug is incorrect. The problem isn't that you can see the invites, it's that you can see the _audit logs_ while in streamer mode. That's the bug we should fix. - Jared on 2017-05-18T20:26:25.815Z

### Checked as of latest canary:

I can no longer reproduce this. Streamer mode hides the audit log completely for me now.

However I have a simple question for @shadiisber . I've noticed that in every other category the name of the category is hidden (like here: http://i.imgur.com/MHabG7W.png). However in Audit Log the white main title is still shown at the top (plus a loading bar for a split second), is this intended?
