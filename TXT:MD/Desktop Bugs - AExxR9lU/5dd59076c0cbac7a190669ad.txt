### Can reproduce.
The issue is that the footer text is too long. Once the footer text is too long, it'll wrap outside of the embed. Once used in conjunction with a thumbnail, it causes the text to appear once per character on separate lines. MacBook Pro: macOS Catalina 10.15.1; Discord Canary 49954
