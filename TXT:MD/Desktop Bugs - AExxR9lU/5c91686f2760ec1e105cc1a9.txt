####Steps to reproduce:
- Join a new server and find a user who only shares that one server with you and isn't a friend 
- Check "Show on Activity Tab" and then uncheck it on the said user 
- Leave the server and then refresh your client 
- Go into your User Settings -> Activity Feed and attempt to click "Show User" on the user from the previous steps

####Expected result:
The user should no longer be hidden
####Actual result:
Nothing happens when you click on the button and the user stays hidden
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.233, Build 34220
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home 64-bit (v1809)
