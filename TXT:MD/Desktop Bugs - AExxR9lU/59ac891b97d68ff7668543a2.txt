Reported by Matthew#2334

####Steps to reproduce:
- Click on the server name 
- Click notification settings 
- Go to notification overrides and  select a channel 
- Turn the notification to "mentions only" or something, as long as it's not "mute" 
- exit out of notification settings then right click on the channel you just selected 
- click mute 
- click on the channel name and go back to notification settings

####Expected result:
when you scroll down to the channel name, you should see the channel name and then 'mute' since it's the most recent setting you applied.
####Actual result:
you see **both** mute and what you selected earlier. e.g mute and all or mute and mentions only
####Client settings:
