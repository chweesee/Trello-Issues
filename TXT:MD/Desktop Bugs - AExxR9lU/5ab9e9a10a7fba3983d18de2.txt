Reported by Rashaun#9295

####Steps to reproduce:
- start streaming (i used obs for this) 
- stream for any amount of time 
- end the stream after a little while (i streamed for almost three hours but the amount of time should not matter) 
- look at your status in the member list and your profile

####Expected result:
Ending the stream should take away streaming status
####Actual result:
Discord still shows you as streaming on both the member list and your profile
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 12608
####System settings:
Win 10 x64
