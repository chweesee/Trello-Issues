####Steps to reproduce: 
- Use a specific emoji a number of times 
- Use another emoji once or twice 

####Expected result:
 The "Frequently Used" list should be populated by the emoji's you've "reacted" with the most. 
####Actual result:
 Populated mostly by emoji's you've never even used, even sometimes not listing the emoji's that you do use. 
####Client version:
 Discord Canary (latest) on Windows 7, but seen it on Windows 10.

### The vast majority of the emoji's in the attached pic aren't ones I've even used. Despite regular use of the "joy" emote, it isn't even listed any more in FU.
