####Steps to reproduce:Open Discord. 
- Minimize Discord by pressing (X) (The "Close" button) on the window. 
- After that, do not press OR click anything OR anywhere else but the key-combination Windows+UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT.

####Expected result:
Not sure, but I think it probably should not appear on the screen as a completely black, un-interactable window.
####Actual result:
Discord appears on the screen, but as completely black window. It is in no way possible to interact with this window.
####Client settings:
Desktop, Release Channel: stable, Build Number: 33990
####System settings:
Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit Version 6.1 Build 7601

### Can reproduce.
Discord does not baton pass active window to anything else like MS Outlook on my machine. Windows key down passes active window, left and right do wonky Aero Snap things on a black Discord (making inactive windows transparent and portions of Discord as well), Windows key up maximizes a white window. Discord Canary 35334; Windows 7 Professional
