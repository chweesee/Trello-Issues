Reported by webhp#1337

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have the Games tab experiment. (This is the hardest step.) 
- Open a game so it displays in the Quick Launcher 
- Click above the play button on the game. 
- Maximize or minimize the window. 
- Reopen the popout and then try to resize the window.

####Expected result:
The popout should remain open when maximized or minimized and dynamically update it's location in the app when the window is resized.
####Actual result:
It closes the popout and does not update the popout's location on the screen.

### I actually never responded to webhp, so I don't know where he got the impression that I thought this was a bug.

I don't believe Discord has ever updated pop ups dynamically like that. This is not a bug. - Jared on 2018-06-18T17:04:22.231Z
