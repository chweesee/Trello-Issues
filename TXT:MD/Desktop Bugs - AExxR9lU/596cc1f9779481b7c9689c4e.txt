####Steps to reproduce:
- Paste a link to an image/video that embeds 
- Don't send the message
- Pase a second link to an image/video that embeds
- Send the message

####Expected result:
The embedded previews are supposed to be in the correct order, ideally.
####Actual result:
The embeds simply load and display in the wrong order, different to the order they were linked in.
####Client settings:
Desktop, 0.0.297
####System settings:
Windows 7 Professional, 64-bit

### This is extremely difficult to fix because we show them in the order they resolve, not the order presented. It's possible, but due to the difficulty we're down grading the priority on this. - Jared on 2017-10-17T00:24:32.916Z
