Reported by Haru ðŸ’œðŸŒ¸#6660

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open a Chrome window or a 2nd Discord client (make sure it's using hardware acceleration 
- Open the screenshare menu 
- Head over to window capture and look at the window previews for Chrome/Discord (Not the Discord client you're currently using, that one shows fine. And no, this bug does NOT rely on having multiple Discord clients, testing it with Chrome is also fine) 
- (Optional) Disable hardware acceleration in these windows to see them working properly

####Expected result:
The windows show what's currently being shown so you know what you're about to screenshare
####Actual result:
The windows remain black so you'll have to manually go check what you're going to screenshare in the window itself (screensharing it afterwards however works fine)
####Client settings:
Stable & Canary 40604
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64 v1809 and Windows 10 Pro x64 v1903
