Reported by mrkirby153#7840

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open the overlay 
- Pin a message 
- Observe the "XXX Pinned a message to the channel" message

####Expected result:
The "See all pins" link should act like a link because the overlay doesn't support pins
####Actual result:
The link acts like a link and clicking it does nothing
####Client settings:
Canary 20644
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64
