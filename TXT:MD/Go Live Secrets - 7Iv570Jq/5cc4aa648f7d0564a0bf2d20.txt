Rather than being forced to join a voice channel while streaming, I think it would be cool if you could stream without a voice channel and then people can start watching your stream by a button on your profile/mini-profile.

### we intentionally tied streaming to voice channels for a lot of reasons. it feels magical to let people join your stream and start chatting w you! for that reason we didn't tie streams to users/user profiles (which is closer to the Twitch model). - Christina Zou on 2019-06-19T18:32:55.303Z
