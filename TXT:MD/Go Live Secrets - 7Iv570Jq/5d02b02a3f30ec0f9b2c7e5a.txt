**Steps to reproduce:**
- Launch Discord as admin
- When client appears, launch a Microsoft Store app
- Hit "Go Live" when it appears (might require adding detection for that game), and confirm
**Expected Results:** You should go live, without being prompted for admin.
**Actual Results:** You will be prompted for admin in-client, and with either selected option, (grant or do without) your stream will load indefinitely.
**System Settings:** Windows 10 Pro x64 (1809) (DxDiag attached from SoT), tested with Sea of Thieves and Fallout Shelter
**Client Settings:** Canary 39636
