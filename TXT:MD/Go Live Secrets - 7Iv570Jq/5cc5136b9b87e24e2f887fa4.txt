**Steps to reproduce:**
- Join a stream
- Open the full viewer
- Observe the header
**Expected Result:** Since there is plenty of room the "Playing in" text should use that real estate
**Actual Results:** It appears vertically for no reason
**System Settings:** Windows 10 Pro x64 v1809 Build 18875.1000
**Client Settings:** Canary 36529
