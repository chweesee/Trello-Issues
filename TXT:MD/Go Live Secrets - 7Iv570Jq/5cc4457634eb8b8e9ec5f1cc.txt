### Not sure if this is a bug or just missing feature so I'm putting it  here. - Isabel Lomas on 2019-04-27T12:05:14.547Z


### To my memory Hearing some devs watching me this morning, the Go Live and Stopping live are very temporary.
So this might be added once the sounds are finalised.  - Alipoodle on 2019-04-27T16:19:02.077Z
