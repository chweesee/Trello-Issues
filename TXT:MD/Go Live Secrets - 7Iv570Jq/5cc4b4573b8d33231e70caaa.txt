### interesting. we did not think many people would want to go fullscreen from pip so this wasn't here. 

we had a also bug over the weekend where the default view was the mini view in your screenshot. default view should actually be theater, which has a button you can use to go to fullscreen. - Christina Zou on 2019-04-29T19:37:58.629Z
