[macOS] If you put a "live" popout in fullscreen, then open Mission Control. You will notice that the popout is uniform to all other instances of Canary visible (such as on your desktop, and the actual Canary window itself.) (https://trello.com/c/XXL9RIEs)

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Have someone begin a "live" session.
2. Join the "live" session and open the popout.
3. Fullscreen the popout.
4. Open Mission Control.

**Expected Result:** Discord windows visible are correctly varied. (Showing on one that the popout is open, for example.)

**Actual Result:** All instances of Discord visible show the popout (or the main Discord window if you do the opposite.)

**Client Settings:** Canary 36529

**System Settings:** MacBook Pro (13", Mid-2012), macOS v10.14.4 (18E226)

### @rage49 could you try this once you get a chance? :eyes: Thanks - Isabel Lomas on 2019-04-28T02:06:43.548Z


### Hmm, I think in general we don't go out of our way to support multiple instances of Discord, moving to wontfix - Athena Yao on 2019-05-13T21:33:43.600Z

### This isn't different instances of Canary. This is both the popout window and the main client @athenayao1  - Isabel Lomas on 2019-06-15T00:32:20.362Z
