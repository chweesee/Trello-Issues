From what I can tell, the Go Live only seems to be streaming at 720p 30fps. As a result, for those who're playing games at 60fps, there is a noticeable drop in quality/smoothness to the image in the preview. Supporting 60fps (at least on 720p resolution) would improve the quality of games being streamed through the system, just like in Group DM's for nitro users.

### Nitro users can indeed stream at 60fps, the same is true for screensharing in DMs/Group DMs today. - Christina Zou on 2019-06-19T18:33:58.539Z
