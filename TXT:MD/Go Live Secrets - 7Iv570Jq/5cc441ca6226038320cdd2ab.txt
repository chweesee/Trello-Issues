**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Have someone begin a "Live" session in a channel you don't have access to.
2. Hover your cursor over them to show the "Live" popout.
3. Click "Watch Stream."

**Expected Result:** Maybe the button should be gr(e/a)yed out?

**Actual Result:** Discord thinks you joined the channel and highlights it white. Reloading will ask if you want to rejoin the channel. While in this state you can also hear if people join or leave etc.

**Client Settings:** Canary 36525

**System Settings:** MacBook Pro (13", Mid-2012), macOS v10.14.4 (18E226)
