This would make it much easier to mute the stream, rather than going into theater mode for the stream them turning the volume all the way down

### I could definitely see this useful, because if you're actually trying to listen to something else at that moment, you could just deafen and expect it to suppress everything for you. +1 - Rage on 2019-04-27T20:25:40.170Z


### The problem I see with this is that sometimes you may want to just listen to the stream rather than the voice chat in the background.

Personally I think an alternative button should be added to mute both so you still have a choice what to listen to. - Solo on 2019-04-27T20:34:44.887Z
