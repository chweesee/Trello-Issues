[Archived] Streaming on an ultrawide display (3440x1440) results in a messy pixel arrangement for the viewer, that is not watchable. Seems to happen only in select games and is not consistently causing the problem for all games. Currently only found to happen with World of Warcraft so far. Also tested with CSGO, Borderlands 2, Beat Saber, and Diablo 3, which do not experience this issue. (https://trello.com/c/jXbpuYSy)
