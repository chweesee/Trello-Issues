**Short Description:** Joining a VC on another client does not disconnect you from viewing a stream in that VC, and if you join a VC on another client and then click Watch Stream, you will be able to view the stream without being in the voice channel on that client
**Steps to reproduce:**
- Join a VC with someone streaming on another client
- Click watch stream
or
- Join a VC with someone streaming and connect to the stream
- Connect to the same VC on another client
**Expected Result:** You should only be able to view the stream if you are connected to the VC on that client
**Actual Results:** You are able to view the stream as long as you are connected to a VC somewhere, which might cause you not to be able to hear the streamer
**System Settings:** Windows 10 Pro x64 v1809 Build 18875.1000
**Client Settings:** Canary 36529
