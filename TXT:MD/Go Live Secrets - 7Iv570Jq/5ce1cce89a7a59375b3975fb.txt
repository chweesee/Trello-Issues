### After verifying I was in the build override, it partially worked. By this, people saw a picture, but when loading up a save game, all sound stopped working, despite it working normally on the main menu. I believe this behaviour was observed last night, but just noting here for ur convenience :heart:  - Boruto on 2019-05-20T12:45:45.612Z


### Can confirm that as of the current Wumpus experiment, this has been fixed. Users can see and hear both Homeworld Classic and Homeworld Emergence (both same engine). Hearing audio is confirmed by a popup saying "discord can't access the audio, grant access" before hand. - Boruto on 2019-06-08T13:23:07.559Z
