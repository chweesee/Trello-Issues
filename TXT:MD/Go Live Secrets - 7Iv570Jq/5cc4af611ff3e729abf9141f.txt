Currently, if you "go live", everyone sees it instantly. You should be able to have a way of "testing" if your system is working before anyone can see it, like how you can do test ingests to Twitch which don't mark you live but send the content anyway, thus allowing you to check if your mic, game audio and game screen actually works.
