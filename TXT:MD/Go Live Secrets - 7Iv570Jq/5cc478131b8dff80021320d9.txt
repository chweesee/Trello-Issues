A specific stream chat would be nice so you can see what people are saying.   

Possibly only accessible from inside the voice chat would be able to see it similar to how teamspeak chats work.

Something similar to how the chat overlay works now would be cool.

### Adding on to this, if https://trello.com/c/KTXCWiAZ is added as well, then maybe you should be able to appoint moderators to your chat. - Isabel Lomas on 2019-04-27T21:50:31.092Z


### this would be a big project, but it's something we may consider down the line - Christina Zou on 2019-04-29T19:35:58.555Z
