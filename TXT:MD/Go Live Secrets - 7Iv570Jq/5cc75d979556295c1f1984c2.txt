**Putting in here now without much of reproducing steps due to no knowledge of what it is**

**Short Description:** [Overlay] Streaming Controls and the `Go Live` bar in channel list fail to show sometimes
**Steps to reproduce:**

While it's unknown I believe it has to do with what channel is considered active in the main client at the moment, were if Go Live server is on it will provide the controls correctly, however it it's not it won't show correctly.

**Actual Results:** Go Live / Streaming controls don't show.

### the outright bugs (1 & 2) should be fixed; 

for 3/4, it's not a good idea for performance reasons for us to put the video in the overlay on top of your game, so we're nixing that for now. Agreed it would be great to have for the future though - Athena Yao on 2019-05-31T01:37:43.582Z
