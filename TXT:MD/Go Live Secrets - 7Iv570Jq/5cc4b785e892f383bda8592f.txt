Rather than being stuck with the very small stream pane, it would be nice if you could adjust it to be larger so you can still type in chats in the background. 

Similar to popout but within the Discord window so it automatically pauses and follows you around.

### the popout is supposed to cover this case, is it not what you want? - Christina Zou on 2019-04-29T19:40:54.093Z


### @christinazou1 My intention with this suggestion was something that fits right into the Discord client like the mini pane does. The popout *can* achieve the same effect but isn't part of the application.

Some benefits of the mini-pane are that it will autopause/stay in the background when you swap to a different app. - Solo on 2019-04-30T02:17:07.717Z
