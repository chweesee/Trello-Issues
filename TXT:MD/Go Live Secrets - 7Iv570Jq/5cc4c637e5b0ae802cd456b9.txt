####Steps to Reproduce###
* Be in 100 guilds
* Get an invite to join a voice channel where someone is live
* Click the invite and observe.

####Expected Result###
You can join the voice channel because it's just part of the guild
####Actual Result####
You can't join and you get a console error about being in 100 guilds, despite the fact you aren't actually joining a new guild, but joining a voice channel in a guild you're already in.
####Client Settings####
Canary 0.0.235 (Build 36529)
####System Settings####
Windows 10 Pro (64-bit), Creators Update (v1709, Build 16299.547)
