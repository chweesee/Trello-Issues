####Steps to reproduce:
- Go into Game Activity in user settings and disable the overlay for a Rich Presence game “I used Fortnite” 
- Launch the Rich Presence game that you disabled the overlay on 
- After the game is started, tab back to Discord and refresh it using Ctrl + R 
- Right after you refresh, switch back to the game before Discord has loaded in 
- After switching back to the game, wait around 20-30 seconds, and watch for the overlay prompt to appear 
- When the overlay prompt appears, enter the keybind that appears on the prompt

####Expected result:
Overlay prompt should not appear, and allow you to open the overlay because it’s disabled for that game
####Actual result:
Overlay prompt appears, and allows you to show the overlay despite it being disabled for that game
