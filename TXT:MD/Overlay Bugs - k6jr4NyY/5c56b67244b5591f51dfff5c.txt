####Steps to reproduce:
- Open your overlay in game 

- Ctrl / 

- See that there is no combo for HH→NK, while there is it app(you have to scroll over)

####Expected result:
The HH>NK combo should be listed in the keyboard combo popup, since it still works
####Actual result:
The HH>NK keyboard combo isn't listed in the popup, even though it still works while in overlay
