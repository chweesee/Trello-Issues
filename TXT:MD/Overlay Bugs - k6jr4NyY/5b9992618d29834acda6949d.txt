Reported by Alipoodle#5025

####Steps to reproduce:
- Crash Overlay (Effective method check Bug 19502) 
- Leave the Reload overlay to timeout (roughly 5-10 seconds) 
- Try to open Overlay (I would HIGHLY recommend a FPS where it's noticeable when the mouse is exited, I used Rocket league in this example)

####Expected result:
Nothing
####Actual result:
Mouse is unlocked from Window as if Overlay were to open. (Clicking anywhere goes back to game)
####Client settings:
Canary 23506 (Client build 0.0.211)
####System settings:
Windows 10 64x (1803)
