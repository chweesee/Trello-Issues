####Steps to reproduce:
- Start SOMA 
- Start OBS, make a game capture source and select SOMA 
- Bug occurs as soon as the game capture finds SOMA

####Expected result:
The overlay should open and display its usual stuff
####Actual result:
The overlay gets shoved into what looks like a 100x100 pixel box in the top left of the screen
