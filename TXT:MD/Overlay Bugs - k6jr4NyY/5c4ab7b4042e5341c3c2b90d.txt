Reported by J1#0088

####Steps to reproduce:
- open the overlay in a supported game 
- block that one friend who never sends you bunnies 
- in the bottom of the chat window, notice the right side of "You cannot....." and the block button

####Expected result:
just like in the app, the button/banner should be centered and not clipped to the side of the window
####Actual result:
the banner has no padding to the right of it when it should
####Client settings:
Canary 0.0.229 - 31316
####System settings:
