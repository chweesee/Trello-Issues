Reported by Lemon#6947

####Steps to reproduce:
- With MSI Afterburner or Steam installed, check if you can open the Steam Overlay or see the In Game Rivatuner info 
- Try to open the Discord Overlay

####Expected result:
Overlay showing without messing with the game/Rivatunner Info
####Actual result:
Is impredecible, but Discord Overlay not Showing and Steam/Rivatunner working and viceversa are the most common ones. Also both can stop working.
####Client settings:
Canary 0.0.189, en-EN (Tested Games are Saints Row 3 and 4 )
####System settings:
Windows 10 x64 version 1709 build 16299.125 / Steam version 1513371133 / Rivatuner 7.0.

### Running multiple overlays simultaneously is not supported. Its more a limitation of overlays than a bug with Discord. - Jared on 2018-01-02T19:05:56.211Z
