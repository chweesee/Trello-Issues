- Have a new user join the server 
- Open the Overlay in a game and go into the channel the welcome message is in 
- Click on the three dots to bring up the message context menu on the message and observe

####Expected result:
The Configure option should not be present as you cannot open the Server Settings panel in the Overlay
####Actual result:
The option is still present
