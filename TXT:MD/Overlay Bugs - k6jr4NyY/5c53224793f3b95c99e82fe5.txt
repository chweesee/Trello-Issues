####Steps to reproduce:
- Use Discord Canary 
- Launch a verified app (make sure overlay is toggled on) 
- Join a voice channel using the overlay 
- Refresh Discord Canary (CRTL + R) (Discord might freeze up a bit but wait for it to load and then overlay should automatically disappear from your game otherwise, press the toggle off button.)

####Expected result:
The game overlay should show after discord has fully reloaded from being refreshed.
####Actual result:
The overlay disappears and never comes back despite pressing the toggle button multiple times.
####Client settings:
Discord Canary, Build Number: 31566, Version Hash: f82f54cdd67577b7f86814df8a22d08b874eb320
####System settings:
