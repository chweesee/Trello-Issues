Reported by DeJay#1337

####Steps to reproduce:
- Using Device Manager's "Display Adapters" tab please ensure you have the following hardware requirements: An integrated Intel Graphics Card and an nVidia GeForce Card on the same device (Any generation of both) *See attachments for examples* 
- Ensure your integrated Graphics Card is not disabled or "uninstalled"  
- Enable the Discord Overlay either before running the game, or after the game starts (Found by lieuwe_berg#8662) 
- Start any version of non modified (Vanilla) Minecraft

####Expected result:
The game should complete it's startup and notify the user that the Discord Overlay is available with their selected keybinds.
####Actual result:
The game either completes startup and doesnt notify the user of the overlay (and the bug must be forced by interacting with a part of the title screen) or the game doesnt complete startup at all. This is due to Discords inability to determine what graphics card Minecraft is using (see attachments)
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.211 (Build 20540)
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home (1803) x64
