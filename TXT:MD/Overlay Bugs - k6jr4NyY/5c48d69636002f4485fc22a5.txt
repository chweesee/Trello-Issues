Reported by J1#0088

####Steps to reproduce:
- open the overlay in a supported game 
- ask your best friend to send you link from a weird domain you're never heard of before 
- click on the link and trust the domain when prompted with "Links are spoopy" 
- click the same link in the app and observe

####Expected result:
since I've already trusted the domain it shouldn't warn me again in the app
####Actual result:
you get a "Links are spoopy" popup for a link from a domain you've already trusted
####Client settings:
Canary 0.0.228 - 31048
####System settings:
Windows 10 home x64 v. 1803
