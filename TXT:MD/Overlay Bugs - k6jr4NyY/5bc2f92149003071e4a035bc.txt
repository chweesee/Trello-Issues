####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Overlay 
- Paste a Spotify Album or Song (that embeds) 
- Rapidly scroll up and down the page

####Expected result:
Nothing
####Actual result:
Overlay will crash after a page or so... (Not the most consistent at happening) Seems to work better with Spotify Client closed as well
####Client settings:
Canary 25872
####System settings:
Windows 10 64x (1809)
