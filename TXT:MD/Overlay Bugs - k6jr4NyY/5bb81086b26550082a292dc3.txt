Reported by Tarek#1337

####Steps to reproduce:
- Own a Nordic keyboard 
- Use Swedish/Danish/Norwegian as keyboard settings in Windows 
- Try to click Shift + 9 (which usually should trigger ] since its a key combo for Nordic users) 
- Observe how the overlay does not let you chat

####Expected result:
It should let you chat with the new chat pin feature
####Actual result:
Nothing happens
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.213 (25221)
