Reported by mrkirby153#7840

####Steps to reproduce:
- Completely restart the overlay to ensure the overlay size is at its default 
- Go to any channel, preferably one without any attachments in it 
- Send enough messages so the chat reaches the bottom of the overlay or resize the overlay vertically so messages are right above the text bar 
- Insert a bunch of newlines into the text box

####Expected result:
The overlay pushes up chat like it does on larger resolutions
####Actual result:
The overlay covers up the chat messages. (This may take a few tries to get)
####Client settings:
Canary 20540
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home x64
