Reported by Andre_601#0601

####Steps to reproduce:
- click into a channel/dm on the overlay
- get a message/dm in that channel
- tab out of (e.g. press windows key) or already be tabbed out of the game, but not tabbed into the channel

####Expected result:
The mention/message should stay visible on the left sidebar until you check it
####Actual result:
The mention-icon/message dissapears after a few seconds like if it was read
