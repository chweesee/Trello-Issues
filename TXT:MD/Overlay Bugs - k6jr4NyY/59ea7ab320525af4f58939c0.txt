### Can reproduce.
i discovered a visual novel game that is made from tyranobuilder, which is made from html5 as it's frontend and as for the backend is css and javascript which does not work with discord overlay. the first game that has been tried with this game entitled teaching feeling (my life with a slave (japan, non steam)). probably html5 prevents overlay injection so discord overlay will not work with tyrano. if ever will work, there is a few games in steam that has this but not worth a price to buy.

### On Discord Canary Build 24815, when I launch the game called PC Building Simulator with Discord's overlay on (apparently was a older version of the overlay as the build from last night was working fine). 

The game would launch, and then would stop responding as soon that I had selected to continue the game. I can see my Discord overlay, but the game is non-responsive. No matter what with the overlay on, the game would always stop responding and it is irritating.

### Can reproduce.
<Game: Apex Legends, Windows 10 x64 Home. If the discord overlay is enabled you cannot aim with a mouse in Apex Legends . A system cursor is on top of the crosshair that moves when you try to aim with a mouse and then snaps back to the center. If you are using a controller you can aim but the cursor is still there.

Action Steps: 
- Enable the Discord overlay for Apex Legends (this can before or while playing)- Launch the game (using any display settings i.e. fullscreen or borderless) - Load into training mode (or a match but training is less chaotic) - In order to show the controller bug simply plug in a controller, and you should see a cursor in the center of the screen (but you will now be able to aim)

### Can reproduce.
Game:apex legends - when the overlay is enabled for the game and you enter either training or an actual match a white dot shows up in the center of your screen and your mouse cursor becomes visible and moves around when you aim. there is another similar issue below this one that a r/discordapp mod said it should have been fixed but that was only partially fixed, the part where you couldn't move your aim in specific.
