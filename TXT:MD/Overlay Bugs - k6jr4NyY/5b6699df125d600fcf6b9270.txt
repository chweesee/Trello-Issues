Reported by JohnyTheCarrot#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Launch Ori and the Blind Forest on Steam 
- Notice how the popup showing you the key combo to open the overlay doesn't show 
- Notice how the overlay also doesn't open on the key combo you set. 
- Notice how it works fine on other games. (The bug isn't Unity engine specific, as the overlay works with Subnautica that was also made in Unity)

####Expected result:
The popup should show telling you the keycombo you chose to open the overlay, and the keycombo actually opens the overlay like it does in all other games. (all I know, this may occur with other games, too)
####Actual result:
The popup does not show, and the keycombo does not open the overlay.
####Client settings:
Canary 20644
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home (Version 1803)
