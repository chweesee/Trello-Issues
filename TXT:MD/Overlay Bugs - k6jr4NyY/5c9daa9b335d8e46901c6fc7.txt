Reported by Alipoodle#5025

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open a game in Overlay 
- On a large server, Click on a user who is unlikely to be cached. 
- Notice they are likely offline and not playing anything 
- Find the same person in Client. 
- Click on them, notice it now caches them.

####Expected result:
When you click on a user they are successfully loaded and Game + Status is loaded
####Actual result:
When you click on a user they will generally show offline + No game, until they are cached in client
####Client settings:
Canary 34671
####System settings:
Win10 64x (1809)
