Works best if the people you are inspecting have multiple colored roles and you have not opened up that server before in the overlay. Windows 10 Home x64 (1803), Canary 20540

Canary 25046 - CR BUT No clear steps to reproduce... and doesn't matter towards server size exactly as this example is only around 50 members. https://puu.sh/BDr2P/4de8cea752.png

### Can reproduce.
CR Win10 64x (1809), Discord Canary 37140 ~ Found what possibly could be a better way of reproducing this bug. Editing a user by removing nickname / lower roles seems to update the user and cause them to remove roles. My Bug Squasher role seemed to vanish after nicknaming myself.
