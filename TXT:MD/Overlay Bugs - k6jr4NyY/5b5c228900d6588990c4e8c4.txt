Reported by Frances Picard#6209

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Discord Overlay 
- Open a server that has locked voice channel below or above unlocked voice channel 
- Put the cursor to locked channel first, it will look like a normal cursor (because it's unclickable) 
- Move the cursor to non-locked voice channel, the cursor will change to clickable link 
- Move the cursor directly to the locked channel again (above or below it, without moving it anywhere else)

####Expected result:
Cursor will change back to normal cursor
####Actual result:
Cursor stays in clickable link state
####Client settings:
Discord Canary build 20174
####System settings:
Windows 10 1803 x64
