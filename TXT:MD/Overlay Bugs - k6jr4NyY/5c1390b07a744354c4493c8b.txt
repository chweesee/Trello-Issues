####Steps to reproduce:
- Have two accounts (main & alt) 
- Login to the main (if not already) 
- Logout and then login to your alt 
- Open a game that supports the Overlay 
- Open the Overlay with your keybind 
- Press ctrl + k and then enter a @ symbol 
- Enter a letter and observe

####Expected result:
The Quick Switcher should only show users that your account can see (via servers/DMs/friends)
####Actual result:
Users from the previous account are shown even though the account cannot see them
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 0.0.224, Build 29657
####System settings:
Windows 10 Home 64-bit (v1803)
