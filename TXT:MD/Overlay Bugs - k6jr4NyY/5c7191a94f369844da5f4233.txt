####Steps to reproduce:
- Open game overlay (in-game obviously). 
- Make sure you can see a spoiler (box or text) on your screen. 
- Close the game overlay and the box or text should stay on your screen for half a second before disappearing.

####Expected result:
The spoilers box/text should close at the exact same time as the game overlay.
####Actual result:
The box/text stays on the game for half a second after closing the game overlay.
