### Can reproduce.
Windows 10 x64 v1803, Canary 21569. Happens with Fortnite as well. A fix for that game session would be just hit overlay keybind twice

### Can reproduce.
When you start the game and enable overlay afterwards, it will still take mouse input, but no keyboard input from my experience. Also happens in the Menu | Windows 10 Pro x64, Release Channel: Canary 21705
