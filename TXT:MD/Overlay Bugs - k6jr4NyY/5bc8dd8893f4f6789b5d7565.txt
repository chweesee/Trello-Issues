Reported by Alipoodle#5025

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open a game with overlay enabled! 
- Open overlay 
- Simply try and mention someone / use the @ key. (SHIFT + ' on UK Layout) 
- This isn't very consistent but happens a reasonable amount of time. Changing a server/channel or reopening overlay seems to reset if the @ key does work for m

####Expected result:
The @ key works.
####Actual result:
@ is ignored. Even though the ' works fine.
####Client settings:
