####Steps to reproduce:
- Log out 
- Log back in to your account 
- Start a game 
- Open your overlay with your keybind 
- Observe how where it says "ESC" is just "???"  also there is really no overlay besides that the client gets bit darkened.​

####Expected result:
There should be a pretty overlay. ✨

No overlay

### This is not a bug. If you log out of Discord the overlay can't function and isn't supposed to. It's like pulling the plug on a monitor. - Jared on 2018-12-14T19:49:10.255Z
