####Steps to reproduce:
- Open game with overlay 
- Call someone in DM (and keep an eye on the Phone icon) 
- Notice it moves 
- Hang up, Notice the Green circle for a half second. (This is meant for when a user is already in a call)

####Expected result:
Icon is still, and no Green icon
####Actual result:
Icon moves to the left and shows an green circle on hang up
