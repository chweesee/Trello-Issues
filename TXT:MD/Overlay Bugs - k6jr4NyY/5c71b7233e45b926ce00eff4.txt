[Text Overlay] The profile card of a user does not update if they get banned, consistently showing them as if they're still in the server (https://trello.com/c/TKyCSkxs)

P3: Will get fixed eventually

Reported by SuperSajuuk#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Enable the Discord overlay for a game (I tested this on TESV: Skyrim). 
- Load this game and toggle the overlay. 
- Either find a user who was banned/left server and had roles, or wait for someone to be banned/leave the server. 
- Find a mention for them in chat that parses. 
- Observe the card.

####Expected result:
Like in the main client, if the user is no longer part of the guild, it should update to show them as being not in the server.
####Actual result:
They are cached as being part of the server and having whatever roles they had before leaving/being banned, which can be confusing for users who're banned.
