[Archived] Blocking a user on Android will hide the "Send a message" option in the overflow menu but does not hide the button at the bottom right which does the same thing (https://trello.com/c/jWW4h562)

P3 - Will be fixed eventually,

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a user's profile 
- Notice that from this screen you have two ways to access the user's DMs : either via "Send a message" option in overflow menu or via the blue button at bottom right of the screen 
- Now block the user and observe those options

####Expected result:
Since those options do the same thing, they sould either both hide or both show to be consistent
####Actual result:
Only one of them hide (the option in overflow menu), the other doesn't (the blue button), which is pointless and weirdly designed
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.9.9
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
