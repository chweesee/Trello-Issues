### I tested it and the solid repro steps are below
1. Find a channel with 1-3 new messages (so that you can still see "new messages" at the chat
2. Open keyboard and chat (or wait when someone chats) until the "new messages" is at the top (keep keyboard open)
3. When it's at the top chat stops scrolling
