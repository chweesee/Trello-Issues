####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a server that 1. Has a category at the very top and 2. Has many other channels below it, enough to scroll quite a bit. You can uncollapse other categories to make the list longer. 
- Collapse the top category. 
- Scroll to the very bottom of the channels list. 
- Scroll back up quickly and look at the arrow next to the top category. You are able to catch it rotating sometimes. 
- For this example I used DTesters by collapsing the information category. Depending on your roles, you may be seeing more or less channels than I am.

####Expected result:
The arrow next to the category doesn't rotate, since it is already closed
####Actual result:
It rotates, as if it was just being closed as you scroll up. This doesn't happen 100% of the time, I got it to happen about 75% of the time.
####Client settings:
Android Alpha 6.3.8
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy J3 Emerge, Android 6.0.1
