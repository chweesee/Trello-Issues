P3 - Will be fixed eventually

Reported by NotMyFault#3732

####Steps to reproduce:
- Set the discord language of your choice  
- Open the audit log  
- See that the date isn't correct, 'today' becomes 'heute', 'yesterday' becomes 'gestern' and so on (It's German for me because that's what my phone language is)

####Expected result:
The time index should display it in the usage you use on discord
####Actual result:
The time index is displayed in the wrong language if it's not on the  form. I've tested it with several languages
####Client settings:
7.7.9
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy S9 Android 8.0.0
