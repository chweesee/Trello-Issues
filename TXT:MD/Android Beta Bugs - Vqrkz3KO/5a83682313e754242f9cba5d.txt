Reported by Maraly#9842

####Steps to reproduce:
- Hold down on the chat field until the "arrow"/option to open the clipboard opens 
- Open the channel drawer either with the back button (if you have that enabled) or the "normal" way

####Expected result:
The "arrow"/clipboard option should close together with the chat field
####Actual result:
The "arrow"/clipboard option stays ontop of the channel drawer or takes some seconds until it vanishes
####Client settings:
Android Alpha 6.2.4
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy S6, Android 7.0
