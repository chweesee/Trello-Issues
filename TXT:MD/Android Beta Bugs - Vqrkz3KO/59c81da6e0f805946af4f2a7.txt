####Steps to reproduce:
- Remove 2FA account on any device 
- Exit discord app mobile, and setup 2FA on PC 
- Once setup, go to your android app again. 
- You should now see old messages(no new messages show, and a "loop" of the connecting that never goes away)

####Expected result:
2 Factor Auth. Should activate and work across devices
####Actual result:
You get a "connecting" screen and user profile looks offline. Along with not being able to do any functions of course.
####Client settings:
Android Alpha 5.2.6

Samsung Galaxy 7, Android 7.0
