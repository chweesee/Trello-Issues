Reported by The Lunala#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a poor interested connection. 
- Send a message to a channel.

####Expected result:
The message should be sent only once.
####Actual result:
The message is sent but there's a toast saying ``Unable to send messages. Hold to retry`` and same message is below it in red. When we hold the message and click resend, the message is sent but the red message below it still says and the same message is sent twice (or the number of times you've retried).
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.7.4
####System settings:
Lenovo vibe K5+, 5.1.1

### Can reproduce.
Can reproduce, this bug caused me being banned from DTesters once because of duplicate messages. It looks like the app doesn't properly cancel/timeout the message post request when the "failed to send message" error appears. Discord Alpha 6.7.4,  Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
