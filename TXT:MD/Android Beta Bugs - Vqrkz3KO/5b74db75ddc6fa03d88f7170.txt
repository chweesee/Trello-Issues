Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to Add a Friend screen 
- Write something then add extra spaces (e.g `"xxx          "` without quotes) 
- Tap on Enter key on your keyboard. Make sure you're using SwiftKey keyboard (it's the default one installed on Huawei devices, also downloadable from Play store). I was unable to reproduce with GBoard 
- Repeat step above a few times

####Expected result:
Nothing should happen besides displaying the invalid message
####Actual result:
A space is removed everytime you hit the Enter key of your keyboard
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.3.1
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
