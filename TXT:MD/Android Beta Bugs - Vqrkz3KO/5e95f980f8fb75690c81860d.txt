Reported by alexander.#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Enable push to talk 
- Enter a voice channel 
- Minimize the voice channel screen (go to a text channel) 
- Hold the push to talk button 
- Move your finger in the left or in the right a bit, so the guild list / member list shows up a bit, but not opens fully

####Expected result:
Discord should let you talk even if due to moving your finger guilds list / member list shows up a bit, but not opening fully
####Actual result:
Discord doesn't let you talk even if due to moving your finger guilds list / member list shows up a bit, but not opening fully
####Client settings:
18.0-ALPHA2 1093
####System settings:
Sony Xperia Z5 Premium 6.0.1

### Bug still present after joining a voice channel. Once the keyboard has been opened once, bug stops occurring, even if keyboard is subsequently closed. If the VC is left and rejoined, bug will be present again
