### I couldn't get my hands on a 5.0.X device, but I am unable to reproduce on a 5.1.1 phone. Everything looks fine and the emoji picker and send button are not greyed out. 

Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime (SM-G531H), Android Lollipop 5.1.1, Discord 5.2.6

I see there's a canrepro on some Android 4 device, I am also unable to reproduce this on Sony Xperia L (C2105), Android Jelly Bean 4.2.2, Discord 5.2.6
