Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Switch to Friends tab 
- Switch to a server and open emoji picker 
- Go back to Friends tab and eventually do stuff (accept friend requests, unblock people, etc) 
- Go back to the server (or a different one, doesn't matter)

####Expected result:
Emoji picker should be closed
####Actual result:
Switching to Friends tab preserves the "opened" state of the emoji picker, so when you switch to a different server you see the emoji picker open unexpectedly
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.4.7
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0

### Can reproduce.
Android 8.1; Huawei P20; Alpha 8.0.1; Going on a server where I have permission to send messages allows me to then keep the menu open on a server where I don't. I am then able to type emotes into the greyed out text field, but I am unable to send anything.

### Can reproduce.
Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, Android 6.0.1, but its kinda different. Mine is if i open reactions in a server then go to another server that I don't have send permissions in, I can use the emotes.
