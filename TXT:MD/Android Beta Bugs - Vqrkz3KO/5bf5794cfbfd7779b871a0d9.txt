Reported by Haru ü•∞#6660

####Steps to reproduce:
- Update to atleast 7.9.7 
- Open a menu which also automatically opens the keyboard (the Search menu, for example) 
- Try to type something

####Expected result:
The text should appear just how you typed it and the bottom bar is blurple to indicate it's focused (What happened on 7.9.6 and older)
####Actual result:
The bottom bar stays gray (meaning it's unfocused) and any text you tried to type doesn't appear
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.9.9 - 8.0.8
####System settings:
Xiaomi Mi A1, Android 9.0
