Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to Server Settings > Overview 
- Remove the server icon. Notice that the Remove button is replaced by a text "Minimum size: 128x128" when there is no icon 
- Pick a new server icon that is under 128x128 format

####Expected result:
As the text says, it shouldn't accept icons under 128x128
####Actual result:
The picture still goes through and you can save the changes just fine
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.4.8
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
