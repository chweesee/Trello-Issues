Reported by Ori#1908

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to any server with channel categories and at least one text channel 
- Press hold on any text channel name and notice the highlighted background of the text channel name for a few seconds 
- Do the same process on channel category name and notice the difference.

####Expected result:
Channel category name should be highlighted perfectly just like any other text channel name when you press hold on it.
####Actual result:
Channel category highlight is off positioned and not aligned to the centre (moved off towards the bottom) and the little arrow before the name of category isn't highlighted completely as well when you press hold on to it.
