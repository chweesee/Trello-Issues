Reported by **I AM someone**#1235

####Steps to reproduce: 
- upload an image to a dm or channel or choice 
- when the bar starts filling up, send, or make another user send a message to the same channel. Or flip your phone.  

####Expected result:
 The bar continues to fill up like normal 
####Actual result:
 The bar resets. Probably just a graphical error, but sometimes images don't send if someone keep sending messages. (Has happened to me a handful of times)
