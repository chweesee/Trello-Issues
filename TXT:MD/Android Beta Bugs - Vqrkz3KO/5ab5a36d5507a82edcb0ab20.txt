Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open YouTube 
- Find a video 
- Share to Discord

####Expected Result:
The link should send without showing any kind of progress bar
####Actual result:
The link doesn't send and shows an infinite file progress bar instead. Only way to get rid of it is by killing the app
