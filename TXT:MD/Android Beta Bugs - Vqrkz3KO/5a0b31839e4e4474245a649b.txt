### Can't reproduce.
I tried literally everything I could do : switching to front camera in-app, fullscreen, not fullscreen, etc. I just can't repro with my device. Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0 Discord Alpha 5.6.7

### Can't reproduce.
I tried the repro steps repeatedly and the images loaded normally. Only "issue" was the images would be reversed (left is right, right is left) which is to be expected. Samsung Galaxy S6, 7.0, 567

### Can reproduce.
can still repo on Android 5.1 Discord 5.8.1

Okori#0902 - Bug Bot on 2017-12-02T16:46:07.181Z


### Can reproduce.
Still there in 5.8.3, on stock HTC One M8 running Android 6.0. More info: issue only shows in portrait mode, both with the phone upright and upside-down (standing on its head). Issue does not show in landscape mode. Issue shows both when I use the in-app viewfinder and when I switch to full screen. Also, it's not only the preview that is upside down, the image itself also saves upside down into the Gallery.
