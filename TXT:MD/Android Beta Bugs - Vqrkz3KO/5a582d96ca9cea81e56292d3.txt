####Steps to reproduce:
- Open discord 
- click the @ symbol 
- it will show the current servers recent mentions 
- click the filter button, switch to all servers 
- the top still says the server name, yet it shows all servers mentions.

####Expected result:
Clicking the @ button will show all mentions from all servers, and changing it to all servers shouldn't show the server name still.
####Actual result:
You are automatically put into recent mentions from the server, and changing to all mentions still says recent mentions from server name, but shows all mentions. Edit: it also defaults to not show everyone and role mentions, and goes back to default settings whenever you reopen it.
