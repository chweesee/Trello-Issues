Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Choose any active text channel, and make sure you're out of it so you can get the unread messages indicator 
- Wait a few minutes for new messages, then go to this channel. It should bring you to the "new messages" red separator. If the last sent message is offscreen, you're good to go. 
- Scroll down until you reach the last sent message 
- Without leaving the channel, click the `@` button to see recent mentions 
- Close the recent mentions panel

####Expected result:
You should be still scrolled at the last sent message
####Actual result:
It scrolled back to the New messages red line separator
####Client settings:
Discord Android Alpha 5.2.7
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0

### As of 5.8.8 I can't reproduce with those repro steps. But instead of going to recent mentions you can just rotate your screen, rotating the screen will always bring you back to the New Messages red separator.
