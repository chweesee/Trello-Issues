[Archived] If you receive a notification from a game that you're not playing, Discord's game detection will think you're playing it (https://trello.com/c/bnORc9fQ)

None

Reported by Ardia#7038

####Steps to reproduce:
- Close all games currently open on your phone 
- Wait to receive a notification from a game (I got one from FFRK for example) 
- Check your Discord Game Detection Service 
- It says I am currently playing a game (FFRK in my case) even though I don't have it open

####Expected result:
Discord should not be detecting a game that I'm not playing even if I am receiving notifications from it
####Actual result:
Discord detects me as playing the game which I got notifications from
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.9.9
####System settings:
Razer Phone, Android 8.1.0

### according to OS, you've used that app. it doesn't discriminate from whether or not you opened it or got a notification

we cant know whether they briefly opened the app or just got a notif - Jeff Cailteux on 2018-11-29T19:34:17.955Z
