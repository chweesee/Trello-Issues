Reported by FoxyKero#9941

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have someone DM you, whether it be image or text 
- Close Discord before they DM you 
- Let the inline notification disappear from your screen 
- Go to Notification center (swipe down for me) 
- Expand Notification and hit "Reply" 
- Send them a DM and ask if they received it 
- Observe

####Expected result:
They should receive the DM and you should see that you sent it in the app
####Actual result:
The DM does not send, and when you go back to Discord you will not see the message sent from yourself
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.4.2 (742)
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy J7 running Android 7.0
