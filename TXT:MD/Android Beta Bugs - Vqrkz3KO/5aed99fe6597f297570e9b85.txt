Reported by Ori#1908

####Steps to reproduce:
- Join a vc 
- Minimize Discord and open another app which supports split screen (YouTube in my case) 
- Tap and hold recent apps bar to trigger split screen and keep Discord in the lower half (occupying around 50% of the screen or less) 
- Go to any server text channel while you can still see the vc bar. Tap on the text field to pop up the keyboard (GBoard in my case) 
- Press back to hide the keyboard

####Expected result:
When you press back, keyboard hides and vc bar is still visible.
####Actual result:
When you press back, keyboard hides along with vc bar which reappears if you go to settings and press back again.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.6.1
####System settings:
Xiaomi Mi A1, Android 8.0.0
