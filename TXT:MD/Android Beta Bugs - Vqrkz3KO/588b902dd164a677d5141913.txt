Reported by Chrys#1856

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Create embed with a field of value ``[Test](https://google.com/)`` (https://p.teknik.io/bSSQn for an example) 
- That's it 

####Expected result:
 Masked links are parsed as such on Android, like they are on desktop. 
####Actual result:
 Masked links are not parsed at all. Probably related to other embed-related bugs. 
####System settings:
 Android 4.4.4, v3.3.0
