Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Switch to Landscape mode 
- Focus the chat textfield  
- Insert @ symbol. The keyboard must be open to do that

####Expected result:
The mention autocompletion list pops up above chat textfield without altering its height
####Actual result:
The autocompletion list crushes/squeezes the textfield, and can even disappear if your keyboard is tall enough. If you can't reproduce, try with a taller keyboard (it really depends on the keyboard height)
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.4.9
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0
