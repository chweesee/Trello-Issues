####Steps to reproduce:
- Join a Voice Call 
- Sign Out 
- Sign back in

####Expected result:
You sign in perfectly and normally (and I think you automatically rejoin the voice call)
####Actual result:
You sign in and on the bottom it would endlessly loop between "Disconnected" and "Connecting"
####Client settings:
Android Alpha 4.0.8
####System settings:
ZTE Grand x4, Android 6.0.1
