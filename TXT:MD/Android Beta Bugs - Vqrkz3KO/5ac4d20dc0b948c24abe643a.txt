[Archived] When you use inertia to scroll down in Recent Mentions, the scrolling will brutally interrupt instead of loading more messages, making you think there is no more messages (https://trello.com/c/QEZq9sog)

P3 - Will be fixed eventually,

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Recent mentions (@ icon at the bottom of channel sidebar) 
- Swipe up and release your finger to make it scroll down with inertia

####Expected result:
When it reaches the end of cached messages, it should be immediately loading more messages and lets you continue to scroll down, exactly like in regular chat
####Actual result:
The scrolling stops, and you have to swipe down again to load more messages and continue scrolling down
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.4.6
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0
