[Archived] Tapping and holding on (selecting) the empty space after a message that ends in a mention within a DM refreshes/re-opens the DM instead of selecting the message. Similarly, doing the same within a server opens the DM without actually touching the mention, but it's unclear whether that specific server behavior is intended. (https://trello.com/c/S76TYpeC)

P3 - Will be fixed eventually,
