### I am still able to reproduce this with YouTube, but it seems intended to me, you are able to move the link/image to whatever channel or DM you want if you have Store unsent text per channel disabled. I assume that it was not possible to move it back when this report was submitted.

Samsung Galaxy S8 (SM-G950F), Android Nougat 7.0, Discord 5.2.6
