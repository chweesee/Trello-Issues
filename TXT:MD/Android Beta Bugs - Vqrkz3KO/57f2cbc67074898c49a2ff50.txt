Steps to Reproduce:

1)  Be in voice server
2)  Press the deafen button (the headset button) multiple times.
3) something is wonky here, I cant tell what is happening to cause it to be inconsistent.
Expected Result: Icons always match up with the current status.  If deafened, the icon appears, when not deafened it does not appear.
Actual Result: Mute/Deafen icons will appear when not mute/deafened.

System Settings:  Android Alpha, Android N, Nexus 6P

### I cannot reproduce this as written.  When repeatedly pressing the deafen button, audio could always be sent/heard when the option rested to ON and could not be sent/heard when rested to OFF.

However, I did notice that the mute/defeaned icons would de-sync.  I'll make a different ticket for that issue.  This one is going into CNR. - Jared on 2016-10-18T16:30:48.421Z
