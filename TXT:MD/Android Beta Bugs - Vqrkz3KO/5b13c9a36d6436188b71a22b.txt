####Steps to reproduce:
- Be part of 4 servers (let's say A, B, C, D) with custom emojis added. You can test with much more than 4 servers, it may increase your success rate 
- Boot up the app 
- Switch to server A 
- Open your emoji picker to ensure emojis from server A are correctly loaded 
- Do the same for servers B and C  
- Now switch to server D 
- Leave the server D 
- Return to servers A, B and C and check the emoji picker for each of them 
- If you cannot reproduce, try again after clearing your app data or uninstall/reinstall Discord and login back. The cache may cause inconsistencies.

####Expected result:
Custom emojis for all servers should always be available
####Actual result:
Some of the servers you previously visited will have their custom emojis disapear from your emoji picker, and you cannot use them, even when typed out, until app is restarted
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.8.7
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0

### Leaving a server is definitely not the only way to trigger this bug. It may also happen randomly while chatting. But those steps are the only ones I found to reproduce this bug consistently

### In some cases the emojis don't disappear immediately, you need to wait a while with the app open
