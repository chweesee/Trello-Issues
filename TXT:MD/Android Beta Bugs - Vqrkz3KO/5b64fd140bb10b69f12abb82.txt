####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to the settings and select "Games" 
- Enable the feature to allow Discord to detect games and give it the permission when prompted

####Expected result:
Discord should detect the game without problems
####Actual result:
Discord keeps crashing over and over when starting the app. It's hard to disable the game detection quickly before a crash.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha Version 7.2.4
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy S4, Android 7.1.2 (LineageOS 14.1)
