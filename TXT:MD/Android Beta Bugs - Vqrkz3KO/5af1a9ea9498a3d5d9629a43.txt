Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a lazy guild, works with DTesters 
- Scroll down through member list. The further you scroll down, the more intense the effect will be 
- Stop scroling down, don't touch anything, and observe the member list

####Expected result:
The member list should remain static, unless the user who changes presence is visible on screen of course
####Actual result:
Everytime a user switches between online and offline status, the member list jumps up and down
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.6.3
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0

### Desktop does the same thing, I don't think this will be fixed in the first release of lazy guilds. It's a tough and expensive fix though I have some ideas how I would do it.
