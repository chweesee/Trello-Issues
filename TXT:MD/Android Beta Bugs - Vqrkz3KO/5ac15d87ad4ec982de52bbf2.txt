### Verified. Report is unclear, but essentially you can login using expired 2FA codes. - Clayton on 2018-04-06T09:02:18.297Z

### Codes are actually valid for up to 60 seconds.  - Jeff Cailteux on 2018-04-09T22:45:10.663Z

### The bug here is that the code while still being valid is showing a "Invalid Code" message. The bug is not that the code should not be accepted.
