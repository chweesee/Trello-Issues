Reported by B a â„¢ a n#7883

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to user settings > my account 
- Upload a new profile picture

####Expected result:
It should not lose quality and be the same as the original image
####Actual result:
It loses it's definition and becomes a bit blurry as compared to the original image. If it's still not visible try uploading it from desktop and then compare the pfp uploaded from Android and the one uploaded from desktop
####Client settings:
Android alpha 6.4.0
####System settings:
OnePlus 5, Android 8.0
