Reported by Curse Broken#8659

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to User Settings > Appearance and switch to the Light theme 
- View a channel topic which contains code blocks and notice that they are white instead of dark gray

####Expected result:
They should be dark gray since the member list is using the Dark theme (confirmed by Jethro)
####Actual result:
They are white
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 5.1.2 (512)
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy S8 (SM-G950F), Android Nougat 7.0
