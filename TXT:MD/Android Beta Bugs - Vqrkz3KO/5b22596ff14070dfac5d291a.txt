Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a server with manage channel perms 
- Long press a voice channel 
- Notice the presence of a "mark as read" and "mute" option 
- Now enter settings

####Expected result:
On the long press sheet I should be seeing a Connect to Voice button, if I'm connected I should be seeing a Disconnect button as well as the pfp of connected users, and I should certainly not be seeing option to mark as read and mute the voice channel. Entering settings should allow me to edit bitrate and user limit
####Actual result:
There is no Connect/Disconnect button ; no pfp of connected users ; there is a mark as read and a mute option ; and I can't edit bitrate/user limit when entering settings, instead I'm given tbe option to see pinned messages and change notification settings
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.9.1
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
