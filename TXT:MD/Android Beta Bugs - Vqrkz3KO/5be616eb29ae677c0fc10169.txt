Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure you have access to the Invite People feature on Android 
- Send a DM to someone, so that the user can be found in Invite People search 
- Have the user block you  
- Go to a server and press Instant Invite in channel list 
- Search the user in Invite People screen 
- Hit Invite

####Expected result:
It should handle the error properly and show an explicit error message. If it is intended to fail silently, then it should handle it gracefully and not puke an error in debug logs
####Actual result:
It silently fails, you won't know what happened. If you go to user settings > debug, you can notice an error message showing that the error wasn't handled
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.8.6
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
