####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to the "+" at the bottom of the server list 
- Hit "Create a new server" and without setting a server icon create a new server 
- Create and copy a new invite link to this server 
- Click the "+" at the bottom of the server list and click "join a server with invite link" 
- Paste the link and click join on top right 
- Observe the new window that pops up showing the number of online and offline people along with an option to join the server

####Expected result:
Depending upon the name of the server, the server icon in the window should be the default one with some text.
####Actual result:
Instead of the default server icon the discord logo appears
