####Steps to reproduce:
- Be in enough server that you have to scroll to see all of them 
- Long press on a server and try to drag it from the top to the bottom

####Expected result:
The server list scrolls downwards, allowing you to put the server near the bottom
####Actual result:
The server list doesn't scroll, and you have to release the app and manually scroll before you can drag it further down
**Note:** autoscroll works if you drag the server outside of the app border and onto the navbar. On phones with smaller navbars this could become a problem.
