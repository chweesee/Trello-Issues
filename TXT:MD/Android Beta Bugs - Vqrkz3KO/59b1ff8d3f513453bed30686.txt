Reported by Xander#0259

####Steps to reproduce:
- Bring up your keyboard (for me it's Gboard) 
- Long press to bring up the copy/paste and text scroll cursor 
- close the keyboard and open the guild drawer (try to do it quickly, it can be time sensitive) -

####Expected result:
The text cursor doesn't clip through the guild drawer
####Actual result:
It clips through the guild drawer then disappears after a short time, 10 seconds or so.
####Client settings:
Alpha 5.1.2
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy S6, 7.0,

### The copy/paste and clipboard option also clips if you swipe the guild drawer out instead of using the back button.
