Hyperlinks without URLs are broken (nothing gets displayed at all / what needs to be displayed doesn't get displayed, what needs to be invisible gets displayed) (https://trello.com/c/KIEsDGXU)

Reported by Aetheryx#2222

####Steps to reproduce:
- View an embed with a hyperlink that has hover text and no URL
OR:

- View an embed with a hyperlink that has hover text, no URL and no space (e.g. `abc` vs `a bc`) in the hover text
 *Side note: if you don't have access to a bot to build embeds, shoot me a DM*

####Expected result:
-The hyperlink text is displayed, the hyperlink hover text is not displayed, regardless of whether the hover text includes a space. This is what it was like before the recent update to embeds.
-Pretty much how it looks like on PC (See attachment #1).
####Actual result:
-If the hover text includes a space:
-Neither are displayed. The hyperlink text and hyperlink hover text are gone. See attachment #2.
-
-If the hover text does not include a space:
-The hyperlink text is not displayed, the hover text is displayed. This should be the other way around.
