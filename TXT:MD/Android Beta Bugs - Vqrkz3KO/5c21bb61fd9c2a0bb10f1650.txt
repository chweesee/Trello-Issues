####Steps to reproduce:
- Set your notification preferences to alert you when you receive a dm, ping or channel notification.

####Expected result:
You should receive notifications based off your settings, such as a notification for a dm, a ping or a channel notification.
####Actual result:
Not a single Discord notification is coming through when I have the app shut down.
####Client settings:
8.2.1
####System settings:
Note 8, Android 8.0.0

### Can reproduce.
Can reproduce consistently with the following steps: 1) Close the app through the recent apps switcher - 2) Get a notification (either ask someone to message you or use a bot that can ping you after a set time) - I have tested this both while having the app still in recent apps aswell as having it closed out of recent apps, when the app is in there it will receive the notification without problems but if you close the app it will prevent the notification from showing - Xiaomi Mi A1, Android 9.0 (December Patch), Discord Alpha 8.2.2 (Tested through DMs)
