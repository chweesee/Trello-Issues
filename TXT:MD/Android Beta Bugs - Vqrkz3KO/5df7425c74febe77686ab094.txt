Reported by Oyasumi!#0880

####Steps to reproduce:
- Request to call someone on Discord 
- Back out of the area where the camera would appear and go back to where your messages are located between you and the user 
- Click the call status bar at the bottom  
- Observe

####Expected result:
The call status bar should return me to the camera being used in call upon being pressed.
####Actual result:
Discord has an error within the call status bar located at the bottom. It does not allow me to click on it to return to call, therefore making me hang up to continue call properly.
####Client settings:
Discord Beta 10.0.7
####System settings:
Samsung Grand Prime, Android 5.0.2
