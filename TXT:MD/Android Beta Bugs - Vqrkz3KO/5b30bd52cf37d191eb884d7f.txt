Reported by Ori#1908

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to any text channel and type #. Notice list of channels popping up. 
- See there's a white circle behind the "#" before channel name. 
- Switch to white theme, and type # in any text channel and try to notice that circle

####Expected result:
Circle should be present/visible
####Actual result:
White circle obviously can't be seen on white background which is because of incorrectly themed white circle.
####Client settings:
