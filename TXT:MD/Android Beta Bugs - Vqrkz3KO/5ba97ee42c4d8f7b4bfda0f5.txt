Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Access Audit Logs in a server with lots of entries 
- Scroll down fast so it stops you before it's loading more 
- Try scroll down more after a few moments

####Expected result:
When you reach the bottom of loaded entries, it should display a spinner icon as the chat/search results do
####Actual result:
No spinner icon. So you don't know when it's loading more or when you reached the end
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.5.5
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
