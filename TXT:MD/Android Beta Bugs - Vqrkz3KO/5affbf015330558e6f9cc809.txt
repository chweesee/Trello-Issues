Reported by Ori#1908

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to user settings and look at the headers such as "USER SETTINGS", "APP SETTINGS" and "APP INFORMATION" 
- Change your system language to Turkish. 
- Again have a look at the headers in user settings that are mentioned above. (You probably have to close the user settings menu after changing the system language, then again open it by pressing the cog icon below)

####Expected result:
The title of the headers should appear normal as "USER SETTINGS", "APP SETTINGS" and "APP INFORMATION"
####Actual result:
The title appears as "USER SETTİNGS", "APP SETTİNGS" and "APP INFORMATİON" i.e. the Turkish letter İ appears instead of regular capital i (I) of English at several places mentioned above.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.7.4
####System settings:
Xiaomi Mi A1, Android 8.0.0
