### Needs more data.
What is the URL that's expected?

I tried `facebook.com/some.user` on my own account, and it works for me.  - Sam Shih on 2018-02-28T23:23:20.509Z


### @lytefast Yeah BogBot altered the Actual Result so it may be not clear. Normally, a Facebook personal URL should be formatted as https://www.facebook.com/firstname.lastname. This bug is telling that the part after "facebook.com/" is replaced by the literal display name of the Facebook profile, so it will look like https://www.facebook.com/FirstName LastName, with spaces. This is invalid and creates a 404 error.

### Tested on Android Alpha 6.3.7:

I can still reproduce this myself. Tested it with hessicajammer#0001 and it went to https://m.facebook.com/Jessica%20Chung%20Hammer (the name on the connection) while the actual should be `hessicajammer`. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2018-03-14T20:06:51.581Z
