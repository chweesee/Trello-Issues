Short Description:  Mutual friends do not have a sort applied to them.
Steps to Reproduce:

1)  View user profile
2)  Select mutual friend

Expected Result: The list of friends should have a sort applied to them, instead of being random. Desktop uses a-z sort.
Actual Result: No sort, as far as I can see random

System Settings: Android alpha, Nexus 6P, Android N

### Tested on version 3.7.1:

Checked one of my buddies' mutual friends list and it's sorted A-Z just fine on Android as well. Can no longer reproduce. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-04-24T18:51:56.749Z

CR, the order seems to be the order in which you have sorted the servers in your list
