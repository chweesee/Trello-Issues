Reported by The Lunala#7777

####Steps to reproduce:
- Clear Discord's data from your device. 
- Open Discord. 
- Login. 
- Observe the screen.

####Expected result:
The notif doesn't appear if you have a strong connection.
####Actual result:
The notif appears in about 2 second which obviously, is less than the time it should take and that doesn't even stay long.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 746
####System settings:
Lenovo vibe K5+, 5.1.1
