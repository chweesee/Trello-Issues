- Now go to discord and open the emoji tab. It doesn't fit very well (first problem) 
- With the emoji tab open, change to the other app in the split screen 
- The emoji tab should close and you have to reopen it

### The emoji picker not fitting well is a dupe of https://trello.com/c/p2xU04vt . and afaik, when switching apps, the emoji picker is supposed to close.
