### Can reproduce.
CR; OnePlus 3T Android O (8.0.0) Alpha 6.2.9. Not just if you are in 100 servers. The bug happens when the invite will appear as expired for your account but not actually is. So e.g. you're in a 100 servers, or you are banned from the server (and opening the invite on mobile data).
