[Archived] You go to server, server settings and then you disable your Wi-Fi. You will be able by going to oreview and by going down then to see the panels with change server background. By spamming the button to select an image to upload it might not fo anything, but i tryed that by myself and it worked. I just needed to spam that for a few minutes/hours to be able to upload one. It might not do anything when pressing it. Is like a 50/50 chance. This is on the Nitro Boost update. (https://trello.com/c/3lrYBc00)

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to your server settings 
- Make sure is your server or a server you can moderate 
- Disable your Wi-Fi/ mobile data 
- Go to oreview 
- Scroll down until you reach the bottom

####Expected result:
You can see the server invite background thing, sometimes it works and you can change the background, but is really hard. It worked for me once and now i can't change it. I need to try alot of times.
####Actual result:
You can change the server inbite background or the server background even if you don't have nitro boost.
####Client settings:
9.0.9
####System settings:
Android 9.0 Pie pr even lower, works on every phone since you can do the steps.
