### You can repro this with devices that have a large screen (and probably navigation bar?) with the given steps without the desktop mode/full mode, I tested it with Motorola Moto One Vision and Samsung Galaxy S9+, both are on Android 9.0, and both are on Discord 9.3.6-SAO-The_Gleam_Eyes.

### It seems like you can also repro this using Fixed Navigation Bar on Android and then joining a VC using PTT, just go to a text channel and you cannot see the PTT button anymore.
