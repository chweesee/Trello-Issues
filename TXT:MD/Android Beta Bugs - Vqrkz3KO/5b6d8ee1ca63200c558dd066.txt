Reported by The Lunala#7777

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open the friends screen and click on Nearby. 
- Click on Find friends". 
- Switch orientation.

####Expected result:
Nothing special happens. The search just continues.
####Actual result:
The search just stops. The stopped position in landscape mode isn't the same as the on in portrait mode i.e the binoculars is not on the eyes of the Wumpus. The screen isn't scrollable and the Wumpus isn't in the center of the screen in landscape mode.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 729
