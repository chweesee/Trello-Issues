Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Send a mention 
- Send a normal text 
- Send a bolded text 
- Compare font weight of texts between each other and between the desktop client

####Expected result:
Mentions should not be in bold by default, so you can use markdown to bold them if you want
####Actual result:
Mentions are in bold by default, preventing bold markdown from having any effect
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.5.9
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
