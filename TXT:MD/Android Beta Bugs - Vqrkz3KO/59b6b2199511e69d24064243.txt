Reported by ZestOfLife~#1757

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to your channel notification settings of any channel 
- Change to a different notification setting 
- Try to change the notification settings again without exiting

####Expected result:
The visuals should change and show that I have selected the option.
####Actual result:
It still shows the option which its changed to and doesn't change and at times also says missing permissions. Gets fixed when we exit that menu.
####Client settings:
5.1.4 Alpha
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy 6 5 Android 6.0.1
