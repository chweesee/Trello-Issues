####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a message that has the maximum number of emoji reactions (20) and make sure that the server you are in allows external emojis. 
- React to it with an external emoji.

####Expected result:
It should return the message "Maximum number of reactions reached (20)" if external emojis are enabled.
####Actual result:
You get an error message saying "Uknown Emoji"
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 4.0.2 (401)
####System settings:

### Can reproduce.
if a channel doesn't allow external emojis, you will get the error if you try to attach one. Doesn't seem to require hitting the limit. (Samsung Galaxy Tab A 6 (SM-T280), Android Lollipop 5.1.1, Discord 4.0.2 (401))
