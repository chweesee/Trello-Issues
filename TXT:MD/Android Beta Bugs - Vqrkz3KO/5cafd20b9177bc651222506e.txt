Reported by Harutato ðŸ’™#6660

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a server with only a few channels so you can't scroll the channel list 
- Restart Discord so it'll launch on the server with a small channel list 
- Switch to another server with more channels 
- Switch to a server with a server banner (Discord Testers for example)

####Expected result:
Nothing, the channel list should be fine
####Actual result:
In servers without a server banner, the channel list will be cut off after a few channels and you won't be able to see the other channels AND on a server with a server banner the app will straight up crash (not always, this is a bit random)
####Client settings:
Android Alpha 8.7.3
####System settings:
Xiaomi Mi A1, Android 9.0 (April Patch, Evolution X 04/10 build)

### While not being super consistent, the crashes also seems to happen sometimes just by switching servers and scrolling through the channel lists
