Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Post a few invite links in chat. Works with only one, but effect is more noticeable when there are several invite embeds 
- Scroll to a point in chat where many invite embeds are visible 
- Rotate screen. You may need to do it repeatedly to notice it. Also you can disable transition animations in your Android developer options, it may help

####Expected result:
Nothing noticeable should happen
####Actual result:
The chat shifts up right after the app changes orientation. It doesn't happen with website embeds, only invites.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.2.1
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
