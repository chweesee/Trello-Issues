####Steps to reproduce:
- Somewhere on random server member has an invalid presence 
- (invalid timestamp format in my case) 
- You open up Discord 
- It starts connection and soon receives READY payload that contains this invalid presence

####Expected result:
Discord ignores an invalid presence and ready to use
####Actual result:
Discord invalidates READY payload as incorrect and starts re-connection cycle
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 5.6.6
####System settings:
Android 6.0 (LineageOS 13.0), Alcatel Idol 3 4.7
