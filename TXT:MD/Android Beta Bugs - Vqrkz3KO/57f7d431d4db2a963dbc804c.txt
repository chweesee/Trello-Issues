### If user A and B are having a conversation with each other and you block both of them, you see the blocked messages notifier with their combined message count. If you then tap to open the messages, both users messages in that block appear. The behavior is identical on desktop.

This is not a bug. - Jared on 2017-07-31T18:02:11.604Z
