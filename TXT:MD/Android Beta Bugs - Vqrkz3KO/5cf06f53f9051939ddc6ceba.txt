### Couple notes:
Also seems to happen sometimes just joining/leaving the vc, could do this pretty consistently but it also happens when self-muted/deafened sometimes
---
The disconnect action button doesn't get rid of the ongoing notification, however the other 2 do, so it can be removed
---
Follow on bug?:
You are able to manage your self mute/deafen status whilst disconnected from the voice channel using the notification. This is consistent with desktop but I don't seem to see a way of toggling this setting without being in a voice channel first
