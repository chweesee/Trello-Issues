Reported by wakfi#6999

####Steps to reproduce:
- Send a link to a gifv in a text channel  
- Add a reaction to it, and then add another reaction to it  
- Remove one of the reactions

####Expected result:
The reaction should be removed and the image should stay in its frame after the message updates
####Actual result:
The image gets shifted up. If there is another gifv embedded directly above it, the first one may intrude into it
####Client settings:
