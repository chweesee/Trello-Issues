Reported by skrillex#8446

####Steps to reproduce: 
- tag a person in a server 
- start typing : or # 

####Expected result:
 The helping box shows up so that you can tap anything you wanted to tag or write 
####Actual result:
 It doesn't. Still works if you get it right, but even a big-letter small-letter difference ruins it, and it's hard to find.
