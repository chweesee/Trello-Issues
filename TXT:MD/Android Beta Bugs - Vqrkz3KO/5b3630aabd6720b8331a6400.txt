####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to channel topic of any server UNDER CHANNEL SETTINGS 
- Look closely just below the channel topic, there's a black line !

####Expected result:
There shouldn't be any black line [in dark theme there are only greyish lines, that's why black line isn't intended, secondly, that line is clearly visible in white theme which is also unintended as there's no line below any channel setting header]
####Actual result:
There's a black line!
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.0.2
####System settings:
Xioami Mi A1, Android 8.0.0
