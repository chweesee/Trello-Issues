Reported by The Lunala#7777

####Steps to reproduce:
- Ban a user on Android with a reason that contains new lines. 
- Look at the ban reason on PC.

####Expected result:
The ban reason contains new lines.
####Actual result:
The ban reason is in a single line with spaces in the places where you had pressed enter. You should either not be able to add new lines on Android or the new lines should show up on PC.
