Reported by Ori#1908

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to any channel settings and in the channel topic, type one letter in each line so that channel topic panel size increase to it's max size that makes it's scrollable [approx 10-20 lines channel topic] 
- Split screen your device and keep Discord to the minimum size. Notice the channel topic size doesn't change accordingly

####Expected result:
Channel topic height should adjust (become) smaller and members list below channel topic is easily scrollable
####Actual result:
Channel topic height remains as it is making the members list below it extremely difficult to navigate
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.8.8
####System settings:
Xioami Mi Ai, Android 8.0.0
