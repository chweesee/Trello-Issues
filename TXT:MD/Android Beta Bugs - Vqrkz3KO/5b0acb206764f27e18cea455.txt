####Steps to reproduce:
- Get a message from Clyde to appear, this can be done by for example messaging someone who doesn't share a server with you 
- Hold on Clyde's message 
- Notice there's a profile option

####Expected result:
It shouldn't appear as Clyde isn't actually a user nor a bot
####Actual result:
It does appear and when clicking on it will give you an empty profile that closes shortly afterwards
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 685
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime ~ Android 7.0 Nougat
