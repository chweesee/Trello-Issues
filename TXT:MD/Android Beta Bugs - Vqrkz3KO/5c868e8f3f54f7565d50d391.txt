Reported by The Lunala#6877

####Steps to reproduce:
- Spoil a link with a really small embed (like discordapp(dot)com/open-source). 
- Observe the spoiler button in the embed.

####Expected result:
The left and right sides of the button are rounded and the text is centred.
####Actual result:
The left and right sides of the button are kinda pointed and the text isn't even centred.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 856
####System settings:
Lenovo Vibe K5+, 5.1.1
