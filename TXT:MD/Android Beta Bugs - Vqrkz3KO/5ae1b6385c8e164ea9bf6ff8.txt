####Steps to reproduce:
- You'll need either a friend or an alt accont to do this.  
- Have the other set to online, idle or in dnd.   
- Exit Discord, but do not close it. (As in do not force close or swipe close.)  
- Have the other go offline.  (Invisible might work too, although I can't confirm.)  
- Open Discord again and check the other's status.

####Expected result:
The other will appear as offline.
####Actual result:
The other remains in the same status they were in when Discord was closed.
####Client settings:
Beta(?) 6.5.6
####System settings:
Sony Xperia G3311, Android 7.0
