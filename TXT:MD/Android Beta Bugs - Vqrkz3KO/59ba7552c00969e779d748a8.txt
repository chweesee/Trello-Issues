Reported by Symplyfyed#4913

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a server with a few people or roles where you're owner/admin 
- Create a category and a few channels for it 
- Edit the category 
- Go to permissions section 
- Select an user or a role 
- Observe the permissions: Some are missing, like the read messages and see voice channels one. Not all permissions available on desktop clients are available on Android too

####Expected result:
You should see/can manage more permissions like the read messages and see voice channels one - but the permissions are missing
####Actual result:
You get just a few list with permissions that you can manage - excluding some like the read messages and see voice channels one
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha - 5.1.4.
####System settings:
Android 4.4.4 - Tablet Allview Viva H8 LTE
