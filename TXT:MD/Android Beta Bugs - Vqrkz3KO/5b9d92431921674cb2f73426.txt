####Steps to reproduce:
- Mute a channel that not everyone has access to (meaning it has a lock next to the hastag) 
- Observe the channel 
- Optional: go to a different channel

####Expected result:
The hashtag will darken indicating you've muted the channel
####Actual result:
No indication appears
####Client settings:
