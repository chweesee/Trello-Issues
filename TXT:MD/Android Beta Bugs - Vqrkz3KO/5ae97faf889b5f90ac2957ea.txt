####Steps to reproduce:
Find or make an emoji which the name of ends with an underscore. In my case, it's <:o_:422323233623375873> Then, send a message in the following syntax: an underscore, a space, and the emoji ending with an underscore. In my case, `_ <:o_:422323233623375873>`.

####Expected result:
The message appears as an underscore, the space, and the emoji.
####Actual result:
The underscore and the space appear correctly, but the emoji doesn't appear. Instead, it gives a string of numbers
####Client settings:
Discord for Android, v.6.5.6
####System settings:
Android 6.0.1 (Marshmallow)
