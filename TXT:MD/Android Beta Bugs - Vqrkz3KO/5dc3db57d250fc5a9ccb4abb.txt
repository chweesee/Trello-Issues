####Steps to reproduce:
- Let two servers A and B. Make sure A is above B in your server list 
- On both servers, upload the same emoji with the same name 
- Switch to server A and open emoji picker. You should be seeing the emote named `:emoji:` on server A and `:emoji-1:` on server B  
- Now switch to server B and open emoji picker.

####Expected result:
Emoji in server B should now become `:emoji:` and in server A it should be come `:emoji-1:`
####Actual result:
The numbering is kept no matter what server you're switched to, as a result you can't use the emote elsewhere than server A from emoji picker, unless you type `:emoji:` manually.
