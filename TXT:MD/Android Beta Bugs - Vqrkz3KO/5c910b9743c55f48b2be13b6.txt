####Steps to reproduce:Listen to spotify on your phone with earbuds (samsung note 9) 
- Someone calls you in the discord dm 
- Before you answer you pause music (sometimes not pausing music creates same bug) 
- You answer call 
- Discord "zones out" and doesnt respond 
- Suddenly connects to the phonecall 
- Discord doesnt pick up your microphone, doesnt matter if its earbuds in or not, it will not pick up your voice 
- This bugs your phone if you disconnect and try to call them on the phone too

####Expected result:
You're supposed to get into the call and talk like normal, your friend should be able to hear you.
####Actual result:
Discord semi- crashes and then connects you to the call. you can hear the person, they cant hear you, voice is gone.
####Client settings:
android 8.5.5 (855)
####System settings:
Samsung galaxy note 9, android version 9
