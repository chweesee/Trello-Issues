Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to User settings > Voice & Video 
- Enable Voice Activity, and switch off "Automatically determine input sensitivity" 
- Slide the sensitivity bar all the way to the right so it's all yellow 
- Toggle on "Automatically determine input sensitivity" 
- Speak to make sure the bar can turn green in settings 
- Close settings and join a voice channel 
- Speak

####Expected result:
It should automatically detect your voice and transmit it
####Actual result:
It acts like autodetection was off, resulting in no voice being transmitted due to what you did at step 3
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.6.3
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
