### I couldn't repro an infinite loading screen, however this seems like a super rare exception, and we show a toast that says the message failed to load the attachment. I think that's sufficient for now. - Sam Shih on 2018-03-26T19:05:04.279Z


### Archiving report as this ticket has been in a resolved state for 30 or more days. - Jared on 2018-07-06T18:50:48.488Z
