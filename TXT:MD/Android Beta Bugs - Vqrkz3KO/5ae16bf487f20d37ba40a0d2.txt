Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure Discord isn't granted permission to access your phone's storage 
- Go to your account settings where you can change avatar. Also works when changing server and group DM icons  
- Tap your avatar 
- When Discord is requesting access to your storage, choose Refuse 
- Observe the error toast showing up

####Expected result:
Should say something like "The app needs to access your storage so you can change avatar"
####Actual result:
It's actually saying something like "The app needs to access your storage so you send attachments", which is out of context
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.5.6
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0
