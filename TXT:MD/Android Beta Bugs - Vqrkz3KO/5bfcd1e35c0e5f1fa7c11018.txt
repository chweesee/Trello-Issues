Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Enable game detection service  
- Exit Discord 
- Use another app or play a game for a good 2-3 minutes  
- Reopen Discord, either via multi-tasking or via a push notification (for me the effect was more violent when opening through a push notification)

####Expected result:
Discord should connect just fine
####Actual result:
In the best case, your app will successfully connect but will still constantly throw errors in debug logs. In the worst case, Discord will be stuck in Connecting state with other errors in debug logs
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 8.0.1
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0

### Can reproduce.
On 8.0.2 I can still reproduce this issue, however it doesn't occur instantly after enabling game detection. A few hours after enabling the detection service, I started getting the same errors again. Disabling and reenabling game detection cleared the errors, now let's see if I'll get them again
