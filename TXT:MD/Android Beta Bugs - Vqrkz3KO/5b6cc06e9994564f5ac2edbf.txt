Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Enable Foregound service for game detection 
- Find a channel with a few unread messages (less than 50) 
- Switch to that channel. If you see the New messages separator and the X new messages banner at the top, you're good 
- Close Discord 
- Open a game and play it for a while. Actually it can be any app, not related to the game detection feature itself 
- Reopen Discord

####Expected result:
It should show only the messages sent after step 4 as unread
####Actual result:
The channel is in the same unread state as observed in step 3
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.2.8
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
