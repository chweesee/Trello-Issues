####Steps to reproduce:
- Have some Nitro users post a lot of animated emojis in any channel (20-30 emojis should be enough for mid-end devices) 
- Try to scroll through the chat history with all those animated emojis playing

####Expected result:
It should be optimized enough so scrolling remains smooth
####Actual result:
Scrolling is very laggy
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.0.6
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0

### Also if you let your app opened for a long time with a lot of animated emojis playing, you phone may warm up and drain your battery

### we are aware of this issue and are actively thinking of ways to reduce CPU load. However we feel like this is a minor inconvience so probably won't divert a lot of resources to addressing this issue.
At least not for the foreseeable future. - Sam Shih on 2018-02-25T11:41:05.296Z
