Steps to Reproduce:
1)  Go into a channel where you can't send messages
2) Exploit one of the bugs to try to send a message
2) Look at Clyde's response
Expected Result: Clyde should send a message saying that its unauthorized
Actual Result: Clyde says the recipinet and I don't share a server, but this goes side with another bug where you can actually type and attempt to send messages in unauthorized areas, but that was already reported.

Client Verison: 3.1.2
System Settings:  Android 5.1 on Tesla Smartphone 6.1

### I'd say this bug is the result of another bug, which is that you can mention bots in webhooks.  Marking this one as Won't Fix, as it'll be fixed when the other one is fixed. - Jared on 2016-10-24T21:28:56.850Z
