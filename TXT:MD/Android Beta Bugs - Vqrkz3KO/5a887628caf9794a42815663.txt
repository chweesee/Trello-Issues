Mod can no longer reproduce

Reported by B a ™ a n#7883

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to your lastest DM 
- Close the discord app (remove it from recent apps) 
- Open discord and while it's in the "connecting" state quickly switch to a server

####Expected result:
You should stay in the server
####Actual Result:
You get switched back to the DM but the problem persists and you can't view a server for more than a few seconds. No matter how many times you switch to a server it jumps back to the DM making it impossible to send messages. I had to reinstall to be able to send messages. If you could not repro try switching as soon as you see the DM and don't wait for the "connecting" banner to appear.
####Client settings:
Android alpha 6.2.6
####System settings:
OnePlus 5, Android 8.0

I can no longer reproduce this myself. I used to have this bug long ago that I kept being redirected to my DM but such is no longer the case for a while now. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2018-03-14T20:18:33.826Z
