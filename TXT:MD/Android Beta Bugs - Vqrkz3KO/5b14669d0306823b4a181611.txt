The name should scroll without any issues
####Actual result:
The scrolling of the name resets each time the time increases by one second.

### Can reproduce.
Reproduced with another rich presence, the JetBrains IDE. It occurred with a long .java fileneme.  It looks like the issue isn't with the XBox specifically, just long names in that area of the rich presence. Moto E4 Plus - Android 7.1.1 (Nougat) - Discord Alpha 6.8.7
