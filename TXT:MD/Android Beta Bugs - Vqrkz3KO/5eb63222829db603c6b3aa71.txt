####Steps to reproduce:
- Do any bug that results in the keyboard being open when the channel drawer is open 
- Close the keyboard, without focusing from the channel drawer panel 
- Scroll down the channel list, until you can't scroll further

####Expected result:
You shouldn't be able to scroll past the last channel in the list
####Actual result:
There's extra space you can scroll to, under the last channel (this goes after the channel drawer is refreshed, say by unfocusing and refocusing on it, or restarting the app)
