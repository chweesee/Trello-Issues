None

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open member list in a server with the boost feature  
- Find someone who has boosted the server (with the pink jowel to the right of their name) 
- Tap briefly on the jewel icon: the "Nitro boosting since" will appear 
- Now tap on it again but hold it down for a few secs. Release your finger: the toast won't appear  
- It might take a couple of tries: as far as I observed, it happens when someone in member list changes presence status while you are holding the jewel. So it works better if you're scrolled down in member list than when you're at the top, and also has more chances to occur in large guilds

####Expected result:
The toast should always appear upon releasing your finger, no matter for how long you press
####Actual result:
If you hold your finger for a certain time on the jewel icon, occasionally, the "Nitro boosting since" toast won't show up
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 9.0.4
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 9.0
