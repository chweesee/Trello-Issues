Reported by Hawlucha#2061

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go in a NSFW channel and make sure the warning is still visible.  
- Press Nope and change the channel before it automatically does it.  
- Go back to the NSFW channel.

####Expected result:
The NSFW warning should appear and the channel contents shouldn't.
####Actual result:
You can see the contents for a split second. Enough for them to flash on your mind. If it doesn't happen, try going to the channel again and pressing Nope again 3-5 times before trying this.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 8.3.2
####System settings:
Xiaomi Mi3W / Android 7.1.2 / LineageOS
