- Make sure your system display size is set to default 
- Change the chat font scale to 117% (it may take a bit for you to hit 117%) 
- Observe how Discord becomes unstable, and starts refreshing at the settings screen and the share screen.

Discord is supposed to operate smoothly, despite the font scale change.
####Actual result:
Discord becomes very unstable, loop refreshing at the settings screen and share screen (may be more places)

Android Alpha 8.7.1
####System settings:

### Moved to notable issues due to the fact, the client is useless at 117% and it's hard to even change it back to default because it keeps scrolling you up after updating the UI. - Tarek on 2019-04-06T14:38:28.759Z


### Can reproduce.
Needs immediate fix. I was almost locked out of discord because it closes the app right away upon each open. Had to be quick. 118% | Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (9.0) | Discord Alpha 8.7.1

### Can reproduce.
This needs to fixed immediately. This is causing the infinite crash loop, rendering discord unusable until reinstalled. Occurs when font scale is set near 117. Redmi 3S Prime, MIUI 10, Android 6.0.1, Discord Discord 871
