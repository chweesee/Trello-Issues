Reported by Rishuru ‚ô°#1764

####Steps to reproduce:
- Start a call or vc with at least one other person 
- Listen to the other(s) in the call 
- While still in the call or vc turn the volume up and down

####Expected result:
You should hear the other person normally, and when messing with the volume slider it should say "Call Volume"
####Actual result:
You will barely hear the other person, they would sound like your volume is all the way down even if it isn't, and when messing with the volume slider it'll say "Bluetooth Volume"
####Client settings:
9.7.7
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy J3 Luna Pro - Android 6.0.1
