Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Search in any server 
- Submit anything that gives results 
- Get kicked from the server

####Expected result:
Search panel should close
####Actual result:
You stay in Search screen. The search results will vanish, but the search result count will stay, and the search bar is still present so you can still try to submit things. Clearly a state in which you're not supposed to be
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.4.8
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
