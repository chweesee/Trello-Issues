CR, Samsung Galaxy A70, Android 9, Discord 16 (1087), you can actually interact with the chat panel when holding on a message and you can view the message context menu, or tapping a user mentions them, and holding allows you to view their profile. Also works when testing the same members list panel

### For this to work, you must first be holding on the server/channel list/DM drawer or the members panel, and then interact with the visible part of the chat panel
