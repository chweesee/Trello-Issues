Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- In the chat input, paste a link.  
- Append a mention right after the link, without space between. It should look like this  (e.g https://www[dot]google[dot]com[at/hash]mention (replace with correct symbols)

####Expected result:
As on desktop, the link should end before the mention
####Actual result:
On Android the link is parsed with the mention in it. Personally I found this bug when pasting a link ending with an anchor tag (#) that matched with a channel name.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.3.4
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0
