Reported by z00z#9825

####Steps to reproduce:
- Get a name of one of your synced Twitch sub emotes (the ones that don't need to be used with colons). 
- In a text channel, or Direct Message, enter a link like "[domain dot com]/[twitch emote name] dot png", no brackets. 
- Observe that an emote will be placed in the URL instead of text.

####Expected result:
A clickable URL with only text and no emotes in the middle of it.
####Actual result:
The emote will appear where its name is in the URL, breaking the URL.
####Client settings:
Android 6.0.5 (605)
####System settings:
Pixel 2, Android 8.1.0
