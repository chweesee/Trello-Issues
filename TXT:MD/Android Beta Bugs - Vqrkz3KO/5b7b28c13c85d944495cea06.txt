Reported by Danijel#9000

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open the members list 
- find a space between the roles (ex: the gap between Discord Employees and Modinators) 
- Try to copy text within chat between the gap

####Expected result:
You aren't able to because the members list is in the way
####Actual result:
You are able to copy text within chat, even though the members list is open
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.3.8
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy Note 8, Android 8.0
