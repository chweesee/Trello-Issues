Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to an NSFW channel in a new server which has unread messages 
- When you see warning message, switch to a non-NSFW channel without doing anything with the warning 
- Look at channel list

####Expected result:
Since the warning hides the chat, it shouldn't be marked as read by simply switching to it, you would need either to accept the warning or mark it as read manually
####Actual result:
The channel has no longer unread messages
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.1.0
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0

### Not a bug. You're going to the channel, so it's marking it as read. - Jared on 2018-01-22T22:24:12.038Z
