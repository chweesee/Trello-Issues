####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to App lock under "Security" in your Xiaomi phone 
- Lock the Discord app, so that every time you exit the app it locks "When device is locked or after exiting app"  
- Try to login, and fill the CAPTCHA (If you get one, probably you will) 
- After submitting the CAPTCHA the app lock will trigger and the discord app will get locked 
- After opening quickly the app lock, the CAPTCHA will restart thus making an infinite loop of login tries 
- *I know it sounds quite a specifc thing, but it happens to me quite a lot because sometimes discord decides to log me off. (probably connection issues)*

####Expected result:
Log in to your account (If you succeed the CAPTCHA)
####Actual result:
captcha restarts and you cannot log in. (One more thing, this isn't an issue about the captcha itself, for example, on the paypal app it does not do it!)
####Client settings:
9.9.3 (993)
####System settings:
Xiaomi Redmi note 4 and  Xiaomi Mi 9:  MIUI Version: 11.0.2 Stable Android: 10 (Checked on both of the devices)
