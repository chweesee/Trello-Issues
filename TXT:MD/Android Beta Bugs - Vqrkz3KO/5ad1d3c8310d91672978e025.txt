### Can reproduce.
Can reproduce, Discord Alpha 6.4.9, Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0. This is not the same as https://trello.com/c/T4NNKEzq/ because basically this report means that going back from the invite doesn't return to browser, but keeps Discord in the foreground. You are not stuck unlike the ticket above says

### Can reproduce.
Xiaomi Mi A1, Android 8.0.0, Discord Alpha 6.4.9 | To clarify, when you open an invite link from the browser you are stuck in the "you have been invited" screen in the app, it reopens when you close it.
