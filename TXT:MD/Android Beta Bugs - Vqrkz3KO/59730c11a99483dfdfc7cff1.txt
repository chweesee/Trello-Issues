Reported by Pretty Lightningreed (PL)#0875

####Steps to reproduce:Have a snack while opening the Servers Sorter 
- Try to move a server (choose the server as low as possible, but higher does work too)  
- Move it up (but let your finger stay on Sort and Manage Servers, else it won't work)

####Expected result:
Your list of servers should scroll up so you can place the flying icon downnn
####Actual result:
Black screen appears, or sorta of.. Weirdammegradon. I can't explain, it seems weird, try it.
####Client settings:
Android Alpha 4.0.0
####System settings:
Oppo Neo 3 Android 5.1.1
