### Somehow that works for me both on Desktop and Android. I have updated my Canary Client now, the bug is no more reproducible for Canary but still on PTB and Stable.

### When I checked the instant invites of my server, even I create an invite for any other channel, it always shows the link was created for the top most channel. You cannot create links for any channel other than the top most channel. Even if you create for another channel, it'll always be made for the top most channel.
