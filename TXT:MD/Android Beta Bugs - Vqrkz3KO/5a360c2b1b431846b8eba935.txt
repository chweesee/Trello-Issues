Reported by [TRED] AlFas#2783

####Steps to reproduce:
- Be part of a server where you have permission to join any voice channel 
- Join any of the ones you have permission to talk on 
- Talk in there with other members using Voice Activity mode to send your voice (unsure if the bug occurs in PTT mode) 
- Keep talking for a few minutes in a row

####Expected result:
You are able to talk normally on the voice channel forever
####Actual result:
At some point the app will stop keeping the call active, users in the channel will be no longer heard, their mute status will remain and your sound will not go through
####Client settings:
Alpha 5.8.6
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy J7 (2016) - Android 7.0 (2GB RAM)

### Can reproduce.
CR Samsung Galaxy S6, 7.0, in my experience it says you're still in VoIP even when VoIP is closed and reopening Discord causes it to open to a blank screen until it's been force stopped.

### Discord becomes unresponsive after joining a VC, you can't disconnect or join another VC. If you exit the app and rejoin you will be greeted with a grey screen and the only fix is to force close the app.
