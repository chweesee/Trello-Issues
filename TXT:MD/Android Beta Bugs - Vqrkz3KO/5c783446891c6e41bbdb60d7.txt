[Archived] When you have a lot of DMs with someone and you clear Discord's data and login with an account that doesn't even have DMs open with that person and then you open a DM with them and send a message to them before the chat loads, you get the type of notification that you get when you're outside the app. [Poor connection specific] (https://trello.com/c/18gqIbV7)

P3 - Will be fixed eventually
