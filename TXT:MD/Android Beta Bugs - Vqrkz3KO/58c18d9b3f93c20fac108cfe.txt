### here's what happens (might be a bit technical):
1) share from app
2) app generates a URI and gives the receiver app activity permissions to read it
3) discord has a proxy activity that just forwards the URI to the real activity
4) handler activity is started with URI forward

the uri permission only allows the receiving activity (specified in 2-3) from accessing the data, so when 4 tries it gets a permissions error - Sam Shih on 2017-03-09T17:54:29.274Z

### Tested on 3.7.3:

Can no longer reproduce myself. This should have been fixed as per 3.6.5 (14 April 2017):

`- Sharing files/images from other apps should work now.`

Pinging @andygarron1 per request and moving to claimed fixed. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-04-24T23:46:23.253Z
