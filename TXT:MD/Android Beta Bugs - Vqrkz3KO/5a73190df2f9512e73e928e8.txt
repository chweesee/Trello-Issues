####Steps to reproduce:
- Be in a lot of average sized servers (personally I'm in 80 servers) 
- Search for something that will generate a lot of results (e.g just one letter, "a" or "e") 
- Wait 3-5 seconds

####Expected result:
Search results should be loading in a separate thread in the background so it doesn't freeze the UI. Could eventually be designed with a loading circle on the UI or something
####Actual result:
A few seconds after typing one letter, the app will start freezing. If search results appear for you before that delay of 3-5 seconds, then it didn't generate enough results to reproduce bug
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.1.9
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0

### Tested on Android Alpha 6.3.7:

I can no longer reproduce this myself. Quickswitcher handles this pretty well now with a limit. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2018-03-14T20:42:56.322Z
