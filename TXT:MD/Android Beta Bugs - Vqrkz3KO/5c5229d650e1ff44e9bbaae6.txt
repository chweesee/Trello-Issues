Reported by kabii#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Set font scaling to a value other than 100% 
- Hold and drag the slider back to 100% 
- At values around 100%, the value will jitter ex. flipping between 99% and 100% 
- specifically, values near 100% seem to have .5% increments

####Expected result:
It is easy to restore 100% scaling
####Actual result:
It can be difficult to scaling to a normal 100%.
####Client settings:
Android Alpha 8.3.6G
####System settings:
Android 8.0.0

It is itself fixed due the fact with the reset button, but cuz of the real time updating its still difficult to set it 100%, therefore the Actual result still happens here, Samsung Galaxy S6, Android 7.0, Discord 8.6.9
