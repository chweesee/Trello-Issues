####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a Server where you have Audit Log permissions and open it. 
- Open the Filter and select Users or Servers. 
- Try to click on the selected option (by default it should be the first one) and observe.

####Expected result:
As it happens in the Settings (try with a Setting that has a circle selection type, like in Voice & Video) it shows a little animation highlighting the box; in the other filters (Quick Switcher for example) it closes the window if it's a chosen option.
####Actual result:
The filter window stays open, with absolutely no animation, until manually closed
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.5.5
####System settings:
Honor 9, Android 8.0.0
