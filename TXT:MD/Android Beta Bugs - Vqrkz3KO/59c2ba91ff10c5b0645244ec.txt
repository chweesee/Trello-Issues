####Steps to reproduce:
-Â Go to a server where you have kick/ban pems 
- Go to Member list and click on any user to view its settings

####Expected result:
Kick and Ban options should appear there, as these options were here in the old settings screen
####Actual result:
There is no Kick or Ban option. Now the only way to kick or ban someone on Android is via the Manage Members screen, which requires the Manage Member role
####Client settings:
Discord Android Alpha 5.2.0
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0
