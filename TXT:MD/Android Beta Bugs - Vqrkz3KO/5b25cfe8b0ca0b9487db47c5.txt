[Archived] You are still given the option to mark as read a server / channel with no unreads, as well as a server with no channels, while those options are grayed out on Desktop (https://trello.com/c/peXSIC8b)

P3 - Will be fixed eventually,

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a server / channel with no unreads, or find a server with no text channels 
- Open the server/channel action sheet

####Expected result:
"Mark as Read" should not be there or should be grayed out as on Desktop
####Actual result:
You can mark as read something already marked as read, or even the void in the case of servers with no channels. It does nothing but sends a useless request to the API
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.9.5
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
