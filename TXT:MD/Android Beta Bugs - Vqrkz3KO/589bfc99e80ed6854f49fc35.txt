####Steps to reproduce: 
- Join voice channel 
- While its waiting for endpoint, disconnect 

####Expected result:
 You would disconnect and the notification that you are in voice channel would get removed 
####Actual result:
 The voice channel notification gets stuck and only way to get rid of it is force stop discord. Disconnect doesn't work either on it because you have been already disconnected. 
####System settings:
 OnePlus 3, Android 7.0.0, Discord Alpha
