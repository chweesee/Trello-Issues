Reported by skrrt#3313

####Steps to reproduce:
- Set your app settings to something (ex. "Push to Talk") 
- Wait for the next update

####Expected result:
If you set your voice settings to push to talk and then update the app your setting will be saved therefore they won't change.
####Actual result:
Your in-app settings reset themselves (such as voice settings)
####Client settings:
4.0.2 (401)
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy S5, 6.0.1
