Reported by [TRED] AlFas#2783

####Steps to reproduce:
- Be a member of a server with no server icon and a big name causing text overflow in the server icon 
- Have someone else that appears in one of those friend lists be a member of that server as well 
- Change tab as many times as needed so that the user appears in the list without being in the previous list 
- Look at the mutual server icon being moved down

####Expected result:
The server icon is normally placed
####Actual result:
The server icon is moved down for a few pixels
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 4.0.3
####System settings:
Android 6.0
