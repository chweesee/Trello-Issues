[Archived] Putting the `#` symbol after the "in:" search filter doesn't display suggestions, but the filter actually works when you finish to type the channel name by hand, and vice versa (https://trello.com/c/gB0hyL38)

P3 - Will be fixed eventually

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- In any text channel or DM, click the Search option to open the searchbar 
- type `in:` to place a channel filter, then place the `#` symbol and start to type the channel name. Observe that it doesn't display suggestions.  
- Now, finish to type the desired channel name manually and click Search. Notice that the filter actually works.  
- Then, make a new search and insert the `in:` filter again, but this time don't use `#` symbol. When you start to type channel name, it does make suggestions, but the filter doesn't work if you manually finish to type the channel name.

####Expected result:
It should be consistent: whether you decide to put `#` or not, if it **does** make channel suggestions, then the filter **should** work no matter if you finish to type the channel name manually or pick a suggestion. If it doesn't, then it shouldn't.
####Actual result:
It's inconsistent: putting `#` doesn't make channel suggestions but the filter actually works, without `#` it does make suggestions but doesn't work after typing manually.
####Client settings:
