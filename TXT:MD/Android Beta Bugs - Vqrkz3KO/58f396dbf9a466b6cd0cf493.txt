Reported by Terminator966#1194

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Join a server with Tableflip on. 
- Be given a role before the 10 minute wait is up. 

####Expected result:
 The "you must wait 10 minutes to talk on this server" message should be gone and you should be able to type in the server. 
####Actual result:
 Message stays, preventing you from talking until app is restarted. Switching channels or servers doesn't do anything. 
####System settings:
 Android Alpha - latest, Android 7.0 Samsung S7.
