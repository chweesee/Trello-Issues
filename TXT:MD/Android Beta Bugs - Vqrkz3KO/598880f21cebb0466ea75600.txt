Reported by Lighthalzen#9176

####Steps to reproduce:
- Click Attachment button 
- Select camera as source 
- Take picture -

####Expected result:
The photo taken should be what you see in the preview/viewfinder. It kinda is, but mostly in the top of the photo.
####Actual result:
It kinda is but in the top of the photo. Which results in you taking a photo that is half wasted space.
####Client settings:
Discord Android version 4.0.2
####System settings:
