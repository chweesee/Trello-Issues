### Can reproduce.
This is not Android version specific, this is budt an inconsistent bug. The correct reproduction steps would be to move the channel inside and outside the category several times. The bug will end up to happen once every 2-3 tries or so. Discord Alpha 6.5.7, Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
