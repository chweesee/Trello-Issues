####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure you have 2FA enabled 
- Logout of Discord 
- Enter you login/password 
- At the 2FA screen, tap tje 3 dots and open the backup code input modal 
- Long press on the textfield. Make sure you have your backup code in the clipboard!

####Expected result:
The "Paste" option should appear so I can paste my backup code
####Actual result:
The cursor shows up without any Paste option. A possible workaround to paste text is to input random text in the textfield and then long-press to highlight the text
