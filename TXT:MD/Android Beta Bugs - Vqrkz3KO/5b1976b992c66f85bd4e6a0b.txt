Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a server with a lot of channels, with all channels marked as read except the very first and the very last one 
- Scroll to the exact middle of the channel list so you don't see the top nor the bottom unread channel

####Expected result:
There should be two unread buttons, one at the top and the other at the bottom, since both are offscreen
####Actual result:
There is only one for the bottom
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.8.8
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
