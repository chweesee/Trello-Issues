Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Tap the Add File (+) button twice quickly. This should open two popups stacking over each other 
- Select an image and press Send

####Expected result:
Either the extra popup should close, or at least it shouldn't have a Send button unless you select a file again
####Actual result:
The extra popup stays open and has a Send button even though no file is selected. Tapping it won't do anything
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.8.6
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
