####Steps to reproduce:
- Get an in app notification. 
- Long press on it and slide your finger away from it to make it get stuck. 
- Share something from a third party app to Discord. 
- In the share extension, select any channel and hit send. 
- Stay in the share extension until the file is fully sent(i.e until it closes automatically).
