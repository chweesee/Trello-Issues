[Archived] The bar/button/header that says the number of blocked messages is of the same shade of black as the message when expanded on Android whereas it's of a different shade of black when expanded on desktop. (https://trello.com/c/Wuwx6FlP)

Reported by The Lunala#7777

####Steps to reproduce:
- Block someone. 
- Find a message sent by them and expand it by clicking the "<number> Blocked messages" button. 
- Observe the shade of black used as background on the message and the one used as background on the button.

####Expected result:
Like on desktop, the button and the background of the message should be in different shades of black.
####Actual result:
They are in the same shades of black. (If you're using light theme like I normally do, the bar will be in white).
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 747
####System settings:
Lenovo vibe K5+, 5.1.1

### Can't reproduce.
Cranking up the brightness to maximum shows two different shades of black. It is possible that on a mediocre display panel, the two colours look almost the same. Essential PH-1 . Android 9.0 Pie . Alpha 7.4.7
