### I checked this bug during the Trello cleaning event. I am still able to reproduce as of Android Alpha 7.0.3 on ZTE Blade Vantage running Android 7.1.1. It took me multiple tries.

Because I was still able to reproduce, I’ll leave this ticket to be since it is still clearly a bug (even if it can be seen as destructive behavior.) - Ghoul on 2018-07-05T19:04:29.873Z
