Reported by The Lunala#6877

####Steps to reproduce:
- Enable 2FA requirement for your server. 
- Remove 2FA from your account. 
- Open Server Settings. 
- Click on the bans sub-setting. 
- Note that nothing happens when you click it. 
- Now, try clicking every other sub-setting.

####Expected result:
All sub-settings other than overview, audit log, emoji and members do not appear or do nothing on clicking like the ban sub-setting.
####Actual result:
You can click on almost all sub-settings that aren't even available on desktop (in this case). Opening instant invites gives the empty "feeling aimless" page; opening the channels sub-settings shows all options but all of them silently fail; opening the roles sub-setting doesn't show the create role button; clicking on the bans sub-setting does nothing.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 850
####System settings:
Lenovo Vibe K5+, 5.1.1
