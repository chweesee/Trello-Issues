Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Send a message 
- Long press on it 
- See the brand new "Profile" option. Tap on it

####Expected result:
The "Profile" option shouldn't be there in the first place if it's your own message. Instead it should show the user settings option as it does in member list when you tap on yourself
####Actual result:
The "Profile" option is still shown even if it's your own message, and this just adds an extra way to reproduce the well known "Able to see your own profile" bug where you can see friend request button on yourself etc
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.7.6
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
