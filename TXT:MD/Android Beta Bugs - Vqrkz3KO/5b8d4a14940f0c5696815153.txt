Reported by The Lunala#7777

####Steps to reproduce:
- Switch to light theme (I should not be telling this. You should already be using it). 
- Open nearby friends and start the Bluetooth search and have a friend with you do the same thing. 
- Send the person a friend request (tell them not to accept). 
- Long press on the person's username and observe the sent text.

####Expected result:
The text is in a colour that can be seen.
####Actual result:
On long pressing, the text goes invisible as the highlight moves onto it.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 746
####System settings:
Lenovo vibe K5+, 5.1.1
