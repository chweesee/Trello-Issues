### Tested on discord stable 5.2.6:

I can still reproduce this partially.

What works: Changing the server icon also changes it on android. Except under one case.

What doesn't work: If you remove the server icon on desktop it won't detect this, nor any of the changes you do afterwards UNLESS you force-close and open the app again. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-09-25T19:42:09.078Z


### Calling this verified fixed. @djscias For your remaining instance, make a different bug for that. - Jared on 2017-10-02T17:33:27.610Z
