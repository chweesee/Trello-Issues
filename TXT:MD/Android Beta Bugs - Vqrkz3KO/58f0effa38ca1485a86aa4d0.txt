Reported by jerbear64#3629

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Type an alternate name for an emoji in the message box (like :rofl: for ü§£, or :+1: for thumbs_up) 
- Submit the message 

####Expected result:
 The emoji alias shows up in the suggestions box and shows up in the submitted message, like on PC and older versions of the Discord mobile client 
####Actual result:
 The emoji doesn't show up in the suggestions box unless you type it by its "proper" name, and certain aliases like :+1: won't show up in the message 
####System settings:
 Nexus 5X, Android 7.1.1, Pure Nexus ROM, Discord Alpha 3.6.5

### Will be fixed in 3.6.6 - Andy Garron on 2017-04-17T18:55:09.970Z


### Can only state this is half-fixed. :rofl: works.

However :+1: shows up as the thumbs up emoji in the emoji fill-in above the message box (so this part is fine). But once you send it will becomes an actual thumbs up on desktop but on android it's displayed as text (: +1 : no spaces) again. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-04-18T10:32:34.006Z


### Can reproduce.
Android 7.1.1 3.6.10 Can confirm still seems half fixed and still manifests with :+1:
