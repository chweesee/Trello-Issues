####Steps to reproduce:
- Have someone with a Nitro subscription add a raction to a message with an animated emoji 
- Have this person add another reaction with a different emoji (no matter if animated or not) 
- React as well with those emojis by tapping on them under the message

####Expected result:
The animation of the animated emoji should continue normally
####Actual result:
The animation resets when you tap on reaction, even if you tap on a different one. It also happens when multiple users react on the message in a short amount of time
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.0.2
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0

### This ticket was checked during the event, but was not able to reproduce anymore as of Moto G4 running Android 7.0. The animation emotes no longer resets, but rather continues on smoothly without any issues.
