Reported by DefinitelyNotLava#9562

####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a lazy server 
- Find a channel with a pretty long message history, ~70ish 
- Scroll up until you find someone you know has a colored name (with a role) or a nickname 
- Realize they aren't colored, nicknames aren't displayed, and their status is offline even if they aren't when you hold on their name or profile picture

####Expected result:
Their data will eventually load
####Actual result:
Their data will never load unless you attempt to mention them, load them in the members list, or hold on their profile, exit the menu, and wait for several seconds
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.6.7
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime ~ Android 7.0 Nougat

### Also reproducable by: Go to a lazy guild, load a channel, exit Discord but don't kill it, wait for 5 seconds or so, open it, go to another channel which isn't loaded (Credits to Okori#0902)
