Reported by Ori#1908

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to any text channel and type a message of one word in one line. 
- Notice after you send 6 messages each in one line, in a row, the 7th Message is a separate one with date and time on it. 
- Notice if you mention yourself, it always makes a new message with date and time. 
- Now type one message per line upto 2-3 messages. Mention yourself and put it between single codeblock.

####Expected result:
When you put your mention between codeblock, it should merge with previous messages and NOT show as separate message with date and time even for a split second
####Actual result:
It shows as separate message for a split second
####Client settings:
