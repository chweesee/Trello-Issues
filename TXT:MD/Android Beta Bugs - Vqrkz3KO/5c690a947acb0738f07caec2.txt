[Archived] When you go to server settings>roles and scroll in the page a bit and then click on any memberless role, the text field has a shadow below it (like it's been scrolled) whereas if you don't scroll, there's no shadow. (https://trello.com/c/0zZHqnI2)

P3 - Will be fixed eventually,

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to your server settings>members. 
- In the at-everyone role page, a bit down. 
- Now, click on any role that has no members. 
- Observe that a shadow of the text field falls below it. 
- Try all the steps (except step 2 and compare results).

####Expected result:
Either the shadow falls in both cases or none.
####Actual result:
The shadow falls in the case in which you scroll.
