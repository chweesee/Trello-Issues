### Can reproduce.
I can reproduce on other browsers than Chrome, so not sure if it's the bounty they're looking for. But I can repro this way, and even if it's not the bounty that's still a bug imo. Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0

### This may also be caused due to slow broadband or broadband dropouts.
