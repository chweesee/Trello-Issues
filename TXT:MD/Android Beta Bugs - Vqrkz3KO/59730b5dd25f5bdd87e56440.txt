### Can't reproduce.
tapping share just copies the link to clipboard and displays a message, pasting that link into a server doesn't do anything weird (Samsung Galaxy Tab A 6 (SM-T280), Android Lollipop 5.1.1, Discord 3.9.9 (398))

### Can still reproduce on 6.1.2, clearer repro steps are: 

1. Enable: "Back button opens channel drawer."
2. Open an image in-app
3. Share
4. Press back - Clayton on 2018-01-25T23:35:31.946Z
