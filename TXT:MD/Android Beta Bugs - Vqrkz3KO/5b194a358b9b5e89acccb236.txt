Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a new server and delete all categories and the voice chat to keep only the text channel 
- Switch to the server you just created if not already 
- Get pinged in a different server, in one of the top visible channels of the server (except the very first one) 
- Switch to the server where you were pinged

####Expected result:
New Mentions appears only if channel is offscreen
####Actual result:
New Mentions button still appears at the bottom and does nothing when you press on it
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.8.8
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
