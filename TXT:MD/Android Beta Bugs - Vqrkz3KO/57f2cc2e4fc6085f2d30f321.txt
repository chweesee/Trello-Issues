Short Description:  If there is to many messages unread (e.g. the client cant find the original newest message) when you click the bar it will auto snap to the bottom.
Steps to Reproduce:
1) Go to a channel you have not been to in a long time (or more then 50 messages)
2)  Scroll up a little
3)  Press the top bar saying 50 messages last missed

Expected Result: App moves you up to the last missed message similiar to desktop, also it should accuratly described how many missed instead of multiples of 50.
Actual Result: App moves you to the bottom of the channel.

System Settings:  Android Alpha, Android N, Nexus 6P(edited)
