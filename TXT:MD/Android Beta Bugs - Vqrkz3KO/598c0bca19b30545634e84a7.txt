####Steps to reproduce:
- Join a voice channel 
- Deafen and mute yourself 
- Unmute yourself and you will still be deafened

####Expected result:
Like Desktop Canary, when you unmute while deafened, you will no longer be deafened.
####Actual result:
When you unmute yourself, you still remain deafened.
####Client settings:
Discord 4.0.2
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy S6, 6.0.1
