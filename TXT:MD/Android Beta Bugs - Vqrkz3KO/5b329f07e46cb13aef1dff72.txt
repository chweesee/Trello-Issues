####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to voice settings, switch on "push to talk" and keep yourself muted already (which can be done by joining any vc and muting your mic) 
- Video Call someone (they need not to pickup the call) 
- Notice your video opens as soon as you video call someone with buttons at the bottom (toggle video, disconnect and mute/unmute) which fade away after like 3 seconds. 
- Click on video button to close your video and see the buttons reappears. 
- Now click again and open your video, and click on close video button JUST BEFORE the buttons at the bottom fades away (like at 2.9th second)

####Expected result:
The buttons at the bottom are still visible when your video is off.
####Actual result:
Buttons disappear.
