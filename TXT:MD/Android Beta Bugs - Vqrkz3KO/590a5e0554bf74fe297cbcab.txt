### CR â€¢ Samsung Galaxy J7 running Android 8.1.0 â€¢ Alpha 8.6.9 (869) â€¢ I have found new reproduction steps:
-get mentioned in a channel you cannot type in
-go to said channel
-press the unauthorized to send messages box
(Note: once you exit the channel, try to go back and do it again, you cannot. You must not have read the channel you were mentioned in for this to work.)
