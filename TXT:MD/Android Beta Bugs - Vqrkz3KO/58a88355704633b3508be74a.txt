### I just came by to check on this ticket during the Trello cleaning event and noticed Alex1304#9704's note as well Tarek's. I tested out the new reproduction steps given by Alex below and was able to reproduce. I was however able to reproduce with the old reproduction steps as well.

I used ZTE Blade Vantage running Android 7.1.1 on Android Alpha 7.0.3. However, because I was able to reproduce this ticket with the new reproduction steps, I will be moving this back. - Ghoul on 2018-07-04T02:18:48.147Z
