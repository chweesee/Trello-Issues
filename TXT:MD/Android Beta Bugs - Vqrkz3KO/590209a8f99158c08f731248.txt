####Steps to reproduce: 
- Force close Discord 
- Find a user that doesn't appear when you type @username 
- Try to hold their avatar (nothing pops up at bottom) 
- Tap on their avatar until the list of users appear 
- It works after their name pops up (Takes longer than normal which is instant)

 Can open user settings at the bottom 
####Actual result:
 Cannot open until you try to mention them 
####System settings:
 Android 6.0 3.7.8

### Seems to me that all these people have:
1. No role
2. Can't find name when list pops-up when typing @name 
3. When user list loads, and a person with a role doesn't load yet (their name is white) they are affected with this bug too until their role properly loads.

### This is what happens when you don't have a user that's cached. Your client can't find them and doesn't have any information on them, so it can't take any action. This is not a bug. - Jared on 2018-03-23T20:50:14.049Z
