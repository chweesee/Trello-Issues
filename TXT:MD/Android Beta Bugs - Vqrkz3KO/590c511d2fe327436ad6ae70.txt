### Tested on Alpha v3.8.3:

I can no longer reproduce this myself.

From what I can tell, it (most likely) got fixed alongside the rendering bug in the note here (v3.8.3, 9 May 2017):
- Custom emojis can render in embeds. But will they? Unravel the mystery.

Not moving as it specifically mentions rendering the emoji and not the embed (which is the core issue here). - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-05-10T02:20:37.286Z
