####Steps to reproduce: 
- Send a message 
- Change your profile picture or username 
- send an internet link 

####Expected result:
 The first message should have the updated profile picture/username 
####Actual result:
 The first message has the old profile picture/username and the second message has the updated profile picture/username. I also get this, when someone else is sending me messages via DM 
####System settings:

### Can't reproduce. Nicknames change immediately, usernames and profile pictures update on first subsequent message as they should. Seems to have been fixed.
