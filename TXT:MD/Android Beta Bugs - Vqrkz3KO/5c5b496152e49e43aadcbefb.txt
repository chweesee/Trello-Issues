### I can't reproduce the issue anymore on Discord 8.5.5 (Samsung Galaxy S6, Android 7.0)â€”I know that @lytefast has not touched the issue, as I can read it from his comment below.

Another Bug patch fixed the issue (I guess), therefore it can be archived or moved to Fixed Bugs.

### New reproduce stepsâ€”adding it for h. reasons:
- Start Discord
- Go to your test server
- Type  (pipe)(pipe)PLACE_HOLDER(pipe)(pipe)
- Replace the P_H with as much emojis 'till it starts a newâ€”in the channel, not in your type boxâ€”line on your side (don't forget the space between the emotes)

At least it triggers only if you start a new line with emotes now, before it triggered with 2/4 emotes and space(s) between them.
