Reported by 3[L]#6567

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open discord with earphones plugged in 
- join a call

####Expected result:
The sound from the call should play via earphones, as, if you have earphones plugged in, you're usually planning on using them.
####Actual result:
Sound from the call plays from the phone speakers instead, because 'use speakers' is on by default for some stupid reason
####Client settings:
9.6.0 (960)
####System settings:
VFD 720, Android 8.1.0
