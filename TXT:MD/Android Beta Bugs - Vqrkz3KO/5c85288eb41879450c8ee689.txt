Reported by The Lunala#6877

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a channel where you have unreads. 
- Ask someone to ping you after you close Discord. 
- Force close Discord. 
- When you get the push notification, click on it. 
- Observe the new messages bar and the bar that tells the number of new messages.

####Expected result:
It only shows the number of new messages after you've restarted Discord and the new messages bar is above the latest messages after you have force closed Discord.
####Actual result:
It says the number of messages you had before closing + the number after restarting app and the new messages bar is in the same place it was before closing Discord.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 856
####System settings:
Lenovo Vibe K5+, 5.1.1
