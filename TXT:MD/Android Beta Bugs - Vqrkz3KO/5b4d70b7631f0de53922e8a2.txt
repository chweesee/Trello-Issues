####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a channel full of messages with rich embeds. For example a bot's log 
- Toggle the "Show website preview info from links pasted into chat." switch in Settings > Text & images 
- Switch to a different channel and switch back to the one you found at step 1 
- Scroll through chat and observe

####Expected result:
No idea if this setting is supposed to apply retroactively, but all embeds should follow the same rule: either they all show, either none of them show
####Actual result:
The setting is partially applied: some of the embeds show, others don't. Restarting the app fixes it.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.0.7
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
