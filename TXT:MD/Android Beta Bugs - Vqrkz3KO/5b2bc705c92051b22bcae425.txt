[Archived] When you have Sync across clients enabled, if you change your Discord language but for some reason fails to sync with other clients (e.g internet cuts out), the new language will also fail to apply locally, even though changing a local setting by definition doesn't require internet (https://trello.com/c/vFqcvSqy)

P4, unlikely to ever be fixed.

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to Settings > Language 
- Make sure Sync across clients is enabled 
- Turn off your Internet connection 
- Attempt to change language, notice it doesn't work 
- Notice it works when you disable sync

####Expected result:
Language is a local setting, so by definition you don't need internet to change it. The only thing that requires internet is the sync phase. So in this situation, the language is supposed to change locally on your internetless client, the only thing that is supposed to fail is the syncing process
####Actual result:
When Sync across clients is enabled, you cannot switch language at all, not even locally
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.9.6
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0

### Can reproduce.
CR, Asus Zenfone 2 Deluxe (ZE551ML), Android 6.0, Discord Alpha 6.9.6, even though I am pretty sure that this is intended because it changes after the app sure it uploads the language setting successfully.
