### Cannot reproduce.  Does this happen when you're sitting at home not doing anything? Or does it only happen if you're out and about using your phone in different locations?

Also, I need the debug logs for when this is actively happening.  Miguel might be able to fix it just from those logs. - Jared on 2017-01-23T23:09:55.815Z
