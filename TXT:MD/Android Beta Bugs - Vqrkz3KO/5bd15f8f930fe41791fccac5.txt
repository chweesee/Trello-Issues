####Steps to reproduce:
- First, send a message to a server you have administrator permission in. 
- Then, react to your own message (this is to help increase the amount of options in the pop-up). 
- Next, long-hold the message to get the message pop-up. 
- Scroll up all the way to the point you need to scroll to get back down (this is why it's small screen size + low-end devices specific. Newer versions and bigger screen doesn't allow you to scroll on message pop-up). 
- Scroll back down and observe.

####Expected result:
The message pop-up scrolls down properly.
####Actual result:
Message pop-up gets cut off to where you scrolled up.
