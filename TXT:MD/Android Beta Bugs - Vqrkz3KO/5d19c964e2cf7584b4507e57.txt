####Steps to reproduce:
- Have Android device plugged into an auxiliary cable connected to an external speaker (in my case, a car radio). 
- Open Discord and start a direct call. 
- Have an unstable cell service (in my case, driving on the freeway with bad reception). 
- Watch for the connection status to go from "Connected" to "Connecting" with a loading circle. 
- Discord will stop picking up all microphone audio and move the call to the phone speakers.

####Expected result:
Normally, Discord will continue to play audio through auxiliary, even when cell service is unstable.
####Actual result:
Audio will play from the phone speakers and will disable the phone microphone.
####Client settings:
Android 9.0.9 (909)
####System settings:
OnePlus 5 (ONEPLUS A5000), Android 9, OxygenOS 9.0.6 (stock)
