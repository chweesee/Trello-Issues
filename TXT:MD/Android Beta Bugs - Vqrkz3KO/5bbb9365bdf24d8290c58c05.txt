Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have someone send an invite to listen along on Spotify  
- Have him end the session so it shows "Listenning party is over"

####Expected result:
It should not show "Join via Desktop app" anymore because it no longer makes sense once the party has ended
####Actual result:
It still suggests you to join via Desktop app
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.6.3
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
