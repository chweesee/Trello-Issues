### Tested on Alpha v3.8.3:

I can no longer reproduce this myself. Using the police car emoji and a custom blob emoji together in one line made them both use the jumbo size.

I feel like this is related to the standard emoji being converted to twemoji. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-05-10T02:24:44.805Z
