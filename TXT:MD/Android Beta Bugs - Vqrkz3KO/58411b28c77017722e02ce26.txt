### Cannot reproduce.  No tagging happened.  Here are my steps:

1) Account A = Server owner on Windows.
2) Disable @everyone permission from role: "Role".
3)  Give "Role" to Account B (on Android).
4) A switches active servers and backgrounds the application.
5)  B posts "hello @everyone" into chat.

Result:  The text "hello @everyone" appears but is not a mention and A does not receive a badge notification.  - Jared on 2016-12-02T18:21:28.277Z
