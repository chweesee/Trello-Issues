Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Edit some settings and do things to add stuff to your local data : edit notification settings, voice settings, accept some NSFW warnings, fill out Frequently Used emojis section, make message search in servers to create search history entries, etc 
- Go to your settings and Log Out 
- Force-close Discord 
- Log in again 
- Check your settings, frequently used emojis, and everything else you edited at step 1 
- If necessary, restart the app again

####Expected result:
Discord should keep your settings after logging out and back in ; it should reset them only if you log in with a different account
####Actual result:
When you log out and restart app, all local data is wiped and everything is reset as if you just uninstalled and reinstalled Discord
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.0.6
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0

### These are settings local to your device and login and are intended to be cleared upon logout. - Miguel Gaeta on 2018-07-25T21:02:20.363Z

### Notably - some of these we may eventually sync across devices like we have for light/dark theme but until then this is the intended behavior. - Miguel Gaeta on 2018-07-25T21:03:07.196Z
