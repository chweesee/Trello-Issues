### This is some context to have a  100 cosists of repro, for @jeffcailteux2

> Steps
 Start Spotify
 Choose a Playlist with more than 4 songs
 Go to home
 Go to Discord
 Wait until it connects (the connecting... banner is done)
 Swipe the notification bar down, where you can see the notification control of Discord
 Skipe one timeâ€”it should display your Title now
 Pause this song
 Skip
 Pause the new song immediately
 Resume now

> Result

It stops forever the listening feature until a restart of Spotify.

### 'Swipe the notification bar down, where you can see the notification control of Discord'â€”I mean Spotify Control in the notification, not Discord, yeah.
