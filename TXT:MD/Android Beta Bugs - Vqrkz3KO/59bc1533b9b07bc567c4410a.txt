[Archived] Link preview creates an invalid message on the client side if the message with the link was deleted right before the preview shows up (https://trello.com/c/rRSjbkqX)

Reported by PLAYER_CHAR#2874

####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a link that has a preview 
- Post it 
- Delete it right before the preview will be shown 
- If you cannot keep up, you can find a website which loads not very quickly (I used <>) and append "?r=<random letters here>" to the link to stop Discord caching the response.

####Expected result:
The message disappears, all is fine
####Actual result:
The message disappears, but then an invalid empty message with the preview of the link shows up
####Client settings:
5.1.2 (512)
####System settings:
Android 5.1

### best way to reproduce this is with a music bot that deletes request as soon as they appear

### can still reproduce, if a bot deletes a message with a image link (that has not been cached yet) instantly the bug occurs
