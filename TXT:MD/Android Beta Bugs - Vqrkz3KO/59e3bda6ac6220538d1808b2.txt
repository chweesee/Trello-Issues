Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- You need two accounts : one logged in on Desktop, another one on an Android device 
- On Desktop, change the Playing status to something that contains text between `**` (only works with bold Markdown syntax, doesnt work with `~~text~~` or `__text__` for example)  
- On your Android device, observe the Playing status of your other account

####Expected result:
The markdown should be escaped/ignored as it's not supported in Playing status
####Actual result:
The text between `**` is displayed non-bold
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 5.3.9
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0

### Can reproduce.
Seems to also italicize the text if the entire Now Playing status is italicized, but strangely does not if only part of it is. It should be ignoring/escaping all markdown. Google Pixel XL, Android 8.0.0, Discord 5.3.9
