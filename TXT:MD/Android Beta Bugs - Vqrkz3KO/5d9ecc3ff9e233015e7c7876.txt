Reported by Qufy#3726

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a Discord webhook (on a desktop of course) 
- Make a POST request with any content to the URL of the webhook 
- Long tap on the webhook "user" next to the message the webhook sent (on the Android device)

####Expected result:
The options menu for the webhook should show its name and there shouldn't be block/unblock/unfriend options.
####Actual result:
Webhook name isn't shown and a bunch of other options appear (Note that external webhooks (MEE6, Announements channels etc) show properly)
####Client settings:
Android Beta 9.6.8 (968)
####System settings:
Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite, Android 9 Pie
