### This ticket was checked during the Trello cleanup event with the new information that it must be tried without a Samsung device with the same reproduction steps because the Samsung devices doesn't have multi-theme'd toasts.

It was tested on Moto G4 running Android 7.0 and Android Alpha 7.0.3, but it was not reproducible, so this ticket will be staying. - Ghoul on 2018-07-06T01:30:48.441Z


### Closing as this bug has been CNR for 30 or more days with no reproductions or new steps. - Jared on 2018-07-06T18:38:16.400Z
