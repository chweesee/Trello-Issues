####Steps to reproduce:
- Join a Voice Channel. 
- Click a user. 
- Under should be options to mute, deafen or move members.

####Expected result:
What is meant to happen is that you should be able to mute, deafen or move members by giving them channel permissions for a specific channel and not a role permissions.
####Actual result:
It makes you not be able to mute, deafen or move members through channel permissions. If you have the permissions through the roles permissions, it would work.
####Client settings:
8.8.8 (888)
####System settings:
Android Nougat
