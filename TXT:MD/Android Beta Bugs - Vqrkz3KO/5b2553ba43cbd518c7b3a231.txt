Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Quick Switcher 
- Write a query that shows no results 
- Tap Join a server button 
- Input a valid invite and join the server 
- Reopen Quick Switcher 
- Try to jump to a server

####Expected result:
Should jump to the server and that's it. If you do it without following the previous steps your Discord will crash but that's not the subject of the report
####Actual result:
The invite screen of the server you just joined pops up again. If you had your keyboard open when tapping the server, the keyboard will stay open in the invite screen
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.9.5
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
