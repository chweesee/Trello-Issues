### This cross-platform bug is a language related issue occurring in several translations. Since this bug is related to translations and not with Discord itself, I have forwarded the issue to https://dis.gd/lang-feedback .

Closing this ticket, since we don't deal with these issues here. - Aeria on 2020-05-07T13:12:35.726Z
