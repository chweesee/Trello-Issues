####Steps to reproduce:
- Join a server with a friend/another user. 
- Click on the username in order to paste it in the text box. 
- Press enter to submit the ping/message. 
- The steps above must be done very quickly. Ping the user and immediately send the message as soon as possible.

####Expected result:
User is successfully pinged, with the ping highlighted in blue.
####Actual result:
The message is simply the username, not including the tag. [e.x. `@Primus` rather than `@Primus#[tag] `]
####Client settings:
Discord v6.6.1
####System settings:
Moto G5 Plus, Android 7.0
