[Archived] On categories, you can't edit notification frequency preferences (All messages, mentions only, etc), unless you have manage channels permission, because "Notifications" item is missing on the category long-press sheet (https://trello.com/c/oQdPNEpK)

P3 - Will be fixed eventually,

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to any server with a category 
- Long press on a category in channel drawer

####Expected result:
There should be a "Notifications" item on the action sheet, because if you have Manage Channels in this server and enter category settings, you can see that notification frequency preferences are configurable for categories
####Actual result:
Notifications item is missing on the action sheet, meaning that you can't configure notification frequency preferences for the category if you can't manage channels
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.8.6
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
