### If the bug is only local to your client, then it's a dupe of https://trello.com/c/DhwPObYO . If the bug can be observed in other clients, then it's because it may take up to a few minutes for game detection service to realize that the game is uninstalled, so it'd be normal behavior, or at least something Discord can't fix.

### We have plans to eventually time out the detected game. But we don't want to be too aggressive because waking up will drain battery life. - Sam Shih on 2018-12-06T00:47:17.643Z

### This should not be an instant thing. There could be up to 2 minute delay in resetting your status - Jeff Cailteux on 2019-01-23T21:19:28.446Z


### Anything game detection related can have long delays before the system is confident you are and are not playing a game. - Jeff Cailteux on 2019-01-23T21:20:07.649Z
