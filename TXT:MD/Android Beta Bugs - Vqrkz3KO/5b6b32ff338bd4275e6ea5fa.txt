Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to Settings > Games  
- Make sure no game is being detected 
- Toggle split screen (Android 7 feature)

####Expected result:
Besides the known bugs involving UI elements being misplaced/missing after toggling split screen, the box should stay grey at least to show that no games are detected
####Actual result:
The box turns green as if a game was detected
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.2.8
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
