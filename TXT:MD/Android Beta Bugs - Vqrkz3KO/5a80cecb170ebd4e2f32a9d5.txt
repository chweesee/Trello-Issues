####Steps to reproduce:
- First, **kill** Discord completely from Recent Tasks (this may be an important step) 
- Open Discord, and be viewing a random channel. 
- Take note of your current screen orientation. Example: **Portrait** 
- Minimize Discord using the Home button 
- Open another random app on your device 
- Change your screen orientation to **the opposite** of the one noted at step 3. In my case, **Landscape** 
- Have someone mention you in a channel, different than the one you were viewing at step 2. This is to trigger a push notification. 
- **While keeping the screen orientation of step 6**, open the push notification

####Expected result:
You are brought to the channel you were mentioned
####Actual result:
You are brought to the same channel you were viewing at step 2
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.2.4
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0

### This is particularly annoying when you open Discord through a notification while you are playing a mobile game that is Landscape mode only, such as Clash of Clans or Geometry Dash
