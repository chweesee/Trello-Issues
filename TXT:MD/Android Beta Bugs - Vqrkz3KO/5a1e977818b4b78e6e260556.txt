Reported by Xander#0259

####Steps to reproduce:
- Type out enough text to have a few lines in the text box, a good size paragraph will do 
- try to scroll through the text. 
- notice the cursor snaps the last word in a sentence (I mean the last word on that particular line of text)

####Expected result:
You can scroll smoothly through text to any point you want
####Actual result:
The cursor will always snap to the last word in a text string.
####Client settings:
577 Alpha
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy S6, 7.0,
