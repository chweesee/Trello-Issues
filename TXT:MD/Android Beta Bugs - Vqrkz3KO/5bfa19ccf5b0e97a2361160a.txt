####Steps to reproduce:
- Be a server owner 
- Transfer ownership to another person and quickly leave server 
- Go to a "non owner account" and view audit logs.

####Expected result:
Audit logs will show you who the ownership was transferred to
####Actual result:
Audit logs show "ownership transferred to null" although if you filter results via "update server action" you can see the actual person
####Client settings:
Discord alpha 8.0.0
####System settings:
