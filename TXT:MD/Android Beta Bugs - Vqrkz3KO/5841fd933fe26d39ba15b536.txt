### my only other theory is that you had the app closed when you got role pinged which caused the cnr, \*\*\*YOU MUST\*\*\* have Discord open and be in a different channel when user pings the role

### I can still reproduce this with steps provided from Okori:

 - Join a new server
 - Switch servers
 - Get a mentionable role
 - Get pinged from the mentionable role
Note: it doesn't work if you close Discord or in a server you're already in

I used a OnePlus 5 on Discord Alpha 6.8.1 with Android 8.1 (Oreo)
