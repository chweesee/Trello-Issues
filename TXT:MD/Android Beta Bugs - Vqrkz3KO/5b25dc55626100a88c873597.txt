Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Pick a channel in a server you can manage roles 
- Go to channel settings > Permissions > Add member 
- Input random letters in the search field so it shows No results 
- Erase the content of the textfield and try to search for something else

####Expected result:
The list of all members should be shown again when erasing search field, and you should be able to make a new search
####Actual result:
The No results manifying glass just fades out and the list of members doesn't come back, everything's empty. Closing/reopening keyboard fixes the issue
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.9.5
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
