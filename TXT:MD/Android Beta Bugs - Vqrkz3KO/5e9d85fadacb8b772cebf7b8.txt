With the left side panel open, while swiping the center panel, there is a column to the right that, if the the user lets go within, the panel will snap to center even though both left and right of it would not (https://trello.com/c/4NQSxxJx)

Reported by wakfi#6999

####Steps to reproduce:
- Swipe to open the servers/channels sidepanel on the left side (tabs UI) 
- Tap and hold the darkened part of the center panel that is visible off to the right 
- Start to drag the center panel left as if to refocus the chat 
- Reverse direction, and bring the center panel back to put it back where it began 
- Right when the panel darkens again, release it. Observe 
- For context on this behavior, try swiping and releasing at different locations on the screen

####Expected result:
The center panel's behavior for whether it will snap to center or to the side of the screen should be based on which side of the screen it is on, and it should be consistent throughout each side what will occur
####Actual result:
There is a column that does not match the behavior of releasing the panel at points left or right of it, which is inconsistent
