### This is NAB unless it stays like that indefinitely. All clients may get a presence update before the member moves, it can take a few seconds for the member to move after that. - Andy Garron on 2018-05-24T06:54:26.084Z


### Moved from Lazy Guild Issues to Claimed Fixed, needs Verification by Andy Garron on 2018-05-24T06:54:41.804Z


### Moving to "claimed fixed" so somebody will give it a shot on the next alpha build. - Andy Garron on 2018-05-24T06:55:11.183Z
