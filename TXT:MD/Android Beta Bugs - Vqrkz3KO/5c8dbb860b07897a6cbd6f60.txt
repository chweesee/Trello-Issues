Reported by The Lunala#6877

####Steps to reproduce:
- Don't have Discord Nitro. 
- Switch to light theme. 
- Go to profile of person with Nitro. 
- Click on Nitro badge.

####Expected result:
The close button is visible.
####Actual result:
The colour of the button is exactly the same as it's surroundings which makes it impossible to see on light theme. I didn't even realise that it existed until I saw a screenshot in dark theme.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 859
####System settings:
Lenovo Vibe K5+, 5.1.1
