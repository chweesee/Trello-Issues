Reported by B a ‚Ñ¢ a n#7883

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open discord initially in portrait mode 
- Go to a server and switch to landscape mode 
- Click on the members icon  
- Click on any user and open his profile 
- Lurk there for a while (didn't work for me until I waited at least 10-15 seconds) 
- Close their profile but do not close the member list yet 
- Switch back to portrait mode and close the member list 
- Click on the 3 lines on top left to open the channel drawer

####Expected result:
The channel drawer should open
####Actual result:
Nothing happens. This is kinda random, might not be able to reproduce the first time.
####Client settings:
Android Alpha 6.0.6
####System settings:
OnePlus 5, Android 8.0

### The only thing that triggers this bug is switching orientation while member list is opened. You don't even need to open a user profile to reproduce this.
