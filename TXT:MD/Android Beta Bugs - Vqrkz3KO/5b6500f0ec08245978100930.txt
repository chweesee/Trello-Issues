####Steps to reproduce:
- Start playing a game/Listening to Spotify and ensure it's detected as a playing status 
- Stop playing the game/Listening to spotify so your status gets removed 
- Observe your playing status in the member list and user settings and compare it with the desktop app

The playing status goes away because you're no longer playing the game
####Actual result:
The playing status gets stuck until you restart the app
####Client settings:
Alpha 7.2.4
####System settings:
