### Can reproduce.
If you remove the server icon the server initials will appear. However, if you change the initials to a new server avatar, the original one appears instead. Samsung Galaxy S8+ 7.0 Nougat 《☆》 Discord Alpha 3.9.7 (396)

### The Play Store patch notes for Alpha 5.3.9 say that this bug got fixed, but it doesn't seem 100% fixed. After you press Remove in the Server Settings, it looks like the icon got deleted and replaced by the initials. However, once you save the changes, the icon's right back until you restart the app.

### Next time file a new bug for the new issue. This issue is fixed but there was a new bug introduced, the icon not updating right away. Either way, its all fixed now. - Jeff Cailteux on 2017-10-24T16:49:20.247Z
