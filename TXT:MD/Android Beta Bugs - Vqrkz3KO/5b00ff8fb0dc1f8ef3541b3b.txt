Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Discord 
- Go to a channel with no particular activity 
- Quit Discord 
- Have someone mention you in a channel different that the one you picked at step 2. You should have received a push notification with ability to reply 
-  Now re-open Discord via multi-tasking or via the homescreen icon, ensure that you don't dismiss the push notification 
- Pull down your notification drawer and hit Reply 
- In the textfield, enter an invalid message. For example, input a Space character and send the message 
- You will see a "Failed to send mesage" alert. Just ignore it, collapse your notification drawer and get back at chatting on Discord 
- After a few seconds, Discord crashes

####Expected result:
The failure alert shows and nothing else
####Actual result:
Discord crashes after a few seconds
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.7.4
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0

### Can reproduce.
Can Reproduce, not just Discord crashes, my device would also do a warm reboot so I'm assuming there's a memory leak somewhere. Happens on all 4 tries I've performed ~ Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime ~ Android 7.0 Nougat ~ Discord Alpha 6.7.4 (674)

### Can reproduce.

### Can reproduce.
Can reproduce. The reply bar on the notification continues spinning after it sends the failure notification. It later sends a Discord isn't responding message, but the app works fine if I respond with wait. Moto E4+, Android 7.1.1 Discord Alpha 6.7.4

### This actually happens when the message fails to send no matter the reason (no internet, exceedi'g 2k characters, input space character, etc)

### Thanks Alex, you are correct. I wish I read your message a bit sooner cause I found this out the long way...
In either case I got a fix for this. - Sam Shih on 2018-06-23T06:30:13.533Z
