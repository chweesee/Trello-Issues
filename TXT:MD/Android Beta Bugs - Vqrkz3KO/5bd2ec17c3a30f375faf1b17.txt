### 1Stormy#0001 was actually on 7.8.1 but did not realize that they had already updated to this version. So there is no way that this issue is happening on 7.7.9 as far that I am hearing.

Edit: ScrxedDev#0001 actually did not reproduce this bug, as they had misunderstood the report completely so ignore their approval. - Ghoul on 2018-10-26T10:37:59.041Z
