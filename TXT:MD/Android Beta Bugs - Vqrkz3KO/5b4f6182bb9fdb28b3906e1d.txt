### Can reproduce.
Nexus 5x Android 8.1.0 alpha 8.0.2 I can repro this but not the exact cut off, if you go into landscape mode and press Add, the Xbox connection will always come up first instead of "Connect you account" then when you interact with the menu you can scroll it up and back down to show the "Connect your accounts" header
