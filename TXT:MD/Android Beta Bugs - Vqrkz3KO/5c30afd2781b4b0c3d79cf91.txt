####Steps to reproduce:
- Have Spotify enabled in Discord. 
- Go to Spotify and play a song. 
- Go to any channel, and find your user. Press on your user. 
- Your spotify status should be showing. Notice the "You played yourself, wait, you can't" box.

####Expected result:
The box is centered.
####Actual result:
Box is off-centered. I highly suspect it's depended on screen sizes.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 8.2.3
####System settings:
LG Fortune, Android 6.0.1
