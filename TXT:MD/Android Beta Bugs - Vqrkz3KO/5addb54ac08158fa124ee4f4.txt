[Archived] With Nitro, on desktop, the external emoji list is in the order you have put the servers in to the left, however on Android the servers are in a completely random order, not alphabetical, not in the order of my list, not in the order of which servers I have joined first, etc. (https://trello.com/c/hZPc2tD1)

Reported by Dyiing#0101

####Steps to reproduce:
- With Nitro, observe the order of the external emoji servers compared to the list of servers you have. 
- If possible, compare the list to on desktop, how the order is different from on Android

####Expected result:
The emojis should remain in the order of the servers on the left side of the app.
####Actual result:
They are put in some random order that I cannot find the servers I have placed at the top of my list.
####Client settings:
Discord Beta App, Version 6.5.6
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy s7, Android Version 7.0
