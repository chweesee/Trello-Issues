### we are missing the translation for this plural message in hr-HR locale. The invite actually resolves correctly, but we error out on the rendering. - Sam Shih on 2018-01-03T01:34:46.854Z


### should be fixed in the release after 6.0.3 - Sam Shih on 2018-01-03T01:58:21.158Z


### @lytefast It seems to be happening to Lithuanian too, probably all the new languages since previous API deploy. - Tarek on 2018-01-22T09:26:37.250Z


### @tarek1337 found and fixed the issue in lt and el. I relaxed our crowdin to android transformer rules so we should see this less now. - Sam Shih on 2018-01-27T07:57:04.269Z
