[Archived] When you make changes in role overrides or create new roles (or basically anything related to roles) in a freshly created server just after you join a new server, the server moves to the second place in the server list and when you close and reopen Discord, it moves back to the top.

####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure that you have sorted your server list at least once (ever). 
- Join a server. 
- Create a new server. 
- Open Server settings>Roles. 
- Keep on spamming the + button until it creates too many roles. 
- Exit out the server settings. 
- Observe the position of the server.

####Expected result:
It's in the top of the server list.
####Actual result:
It's in the second position in the server list and when you force close and reopen Discord, it moves back to top again.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 738
