Reported by Alfred#7814

####Steps to reproduce:You have to change your password on desktop or else than your smartphone. Discord will stay opened, not telling anything about the fact you have to manually log-off/log-in to gain full access again.

####Expected result:
You should get a clear message than your session has changed, or you should get simply disconnected.
####Actual result:
Discord stays in a kind of semi-connected state, you can still see your friend list, but servers won't show up, You can think it's bugged because friend list remains open, but you cannot access to any server and the hourglass "connecting" keeps showing, Manually killing the process and restarting the phone won't change anything, discord will stay in that kind of limited connected state. until you manually log-off.
####Client settings:
Android 5.1.2
####System settings:
Android 7.0
