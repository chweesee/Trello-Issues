### We decided here together with the reporter to get the 100% way to reproduce the issue, as to say in the steps 'You have to find a not cached Voice channel'

It happens more like for newbies of a server or if you have installed Discord new, or if a streamer/content creator hyperlinks a voice channel, or other ways where the voice channel is not cached (I assume it's because of the caching)
