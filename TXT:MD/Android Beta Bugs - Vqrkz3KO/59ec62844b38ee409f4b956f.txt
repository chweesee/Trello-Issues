####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure you are signed out of every single device for your Discord account except for your Android device 
- Join a really active server that's really huge, possibly 24,000 members, if you are in Hypesquad that server will work 
- Wait for someone (Mallory) to do an @ everyone 
- View the ping them switch back to another server or DM 
- Click the Menu button and close Discord 
- Launch Discord again

####Expected result:
The app should remember you saw the ping
####Actual result:
The app doesn't and will always show a red notification badge from where the ping was until you view it from a PC or laptop
####Client settings:
Android Alpha 5.3.9
####System settings:
Android 7.0 Moto G4

### Just a side note, this actually has happened to me, if I get pinged on a network. Then try to clear it from an another network.

So to explain it in a easier way.
 - Get pinged from your home network, but don't view it.
 - Try to view/clear it on an another network, such as 4G: 

Has happened a few times when the Android Alpha role gets pinged, but that's sometimes.
I tried this on a OnePlus 5 device, running oreo. Discord Alpha 5.0.6, moving to user reported for verification. - Tarek on 2018-01-07T06:44:17.111Z
