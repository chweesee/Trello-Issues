####Steps to reproduce:
- Open the server sorter by holding on a servers icon in the server list 
- Ensure you are in enough servers so that at least another screens worth of servers is above your view 
- Scroll to the bottom of the list, or anywhere in the list where there a considerable amount of servers above your view 
- Move the server closest to the top of your screen upwards, make sure that you hold the server above the title bar

####Expected result:
Server should move up smoothly, as with downwards scrolling
####Actual result:
The server list jumps up and down violently
####Client settings:
Android Alpha 3.9.9
####System settings:
