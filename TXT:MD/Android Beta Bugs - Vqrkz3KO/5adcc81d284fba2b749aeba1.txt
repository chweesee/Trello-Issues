Reported by RoccoDev#2837

####Steps to reproduce:
- Change your language to Italian (if it already isn't) 
- Check a message sent the day before

####Expected result:
Message is showing as posted 'Yesterday at etc.'
####Actual result:
Instead, it's showing as 'Date Time' (e.g, 21 apr 2018 15:04). Also, 'Today' is not shown for messages sent that day. **Note, when switching between languages, due to another bug, you may need to restart the client.**
####Client settings:
Beta 6.5.5
####System settings:
LineageOS 15.1 (Android 8.1) on Asus Zenfone 2 Laser (ZE550KL)
