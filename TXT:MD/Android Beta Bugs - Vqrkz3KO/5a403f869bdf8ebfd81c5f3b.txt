### It does not appear to happen on Android 5.1. Tested using Moto E 2nd Generation, Android 5.1, Android Alpha 5.9.7 Maybe specific to Android 6 and 7 on some specific device like LG and Samsung? Not really sure, tbh.

- Galaxy S5 4.4.2, stable 5.9.1

### 3rd party library  - https://github.com/google/cameraview added by Sam Shih on 2018-01-29T22:24:49.493Z


### I added a try catch to mitigate the issue, but for now our efforts on in app camera are low priority since there's an easy workaround (external app).

Some background: we rely on a [3rd party library](https://github.com/google/cameraview) which is currently inactive, and there aren't any good alternatives that use the Camera2 API.

More info: we actually open sourced this aspect of the app here: [FlexInput](https://github.com/lytefast/flex-input/tree/master/flexinput) and I have an issue to track the progress on alternatives https://github.com/lytefast/flex-input/issues/37 - Sam Shih on 2018-01-29T22:27:43.389Z


### Can't reproduce.
LG Stylo 2 Android 6.1.1 Discord Beta 6.5.6
