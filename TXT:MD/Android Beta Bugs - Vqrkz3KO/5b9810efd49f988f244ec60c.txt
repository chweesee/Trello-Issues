### Can reproduce.
I can't add more than 100 emojis. But since 1 unicode emoji is supposed to take place of 2 characters (emojis are encoded on 2 bytes), you should be able to put 50 emojis max. Desktop doesnt' allow more than 50 emojis but you can put 100 on Android. Discord Alpha 7.4.8,  Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
