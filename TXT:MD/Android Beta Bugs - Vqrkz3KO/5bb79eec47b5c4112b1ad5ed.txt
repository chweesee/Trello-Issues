Reported by The Lunala#7777

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open notification settings of a server. 
- Scroll down to the bottom.

####Expected result:
There's a line separating the two toggles because they're two different things.
####Actual result:
There's no line separating them.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 763
####System settings:
Lenovo vibe K5+, 5.1.1
