### I am able to reproduce this bug using the steps & info below, as provided by Symplyfyed#4047. The devices I tested on were a Pixel XL running Android 5.1.1 and a Pixel XL running Android 8.1.0 DP:

- Go to a text channel
- Select then send an emoji
- Watch your emoji picker list

Expected Result: When you reopen the emoji picker (or just keep looking at it) a new section with frequently used emojis should appear, together with the emoji that sent
Actual Result: The list doesn't appear until you restart the client - Chris Cox on 2017-10-30T05:33:55.463Z
