[Archived] Editing a user's discriminator in search doesn't trigger caching of the user (https://trello.com/c/39MbJvY4)

P3 - Will be fixed eventually

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:

- Find a user that is offline/invisible in a large guild 
- Use the `from:` search filter to search messages from this user 
- After successfully searching, Force-close Discord in order to clear cache 
- Re-open Discord, re-open Search, and tap on the search history entry corresponding to the search of previous step 
- In the prefilled searchbar, delete the last 1-2 digits of the discriminator 
- Wait indefinitely. Notice how the user will never appear in the autocomplete 
- Continue deleting characters until the discriminator is fully gone, and again, wait indefinitely. Notice how the user will end up to show up in autocomplete

####Expected result:
Adding/deleting characters in the discriminator of the user should trigger its caching
####Actual result:
The user will stay uncached no matter how long you wait, only editing the username will make it cached eventually (you know that a user becomes "cached" when they appear in autocomplete of the `from:` filter)
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 8.5.6
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
