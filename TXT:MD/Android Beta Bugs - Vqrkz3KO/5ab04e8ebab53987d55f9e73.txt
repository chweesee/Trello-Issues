Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Either uninstall/reinstall Discord or go in app manager > Discord > wipe data 
- Open Discord, login, and look at your frequently used emojis

####Expected result:
This section should be empty
####Actual result:
It's already filled with some emojis, so it's actually impossible to have a clean frequently used emojis section
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.3.8
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0
