Reported by The Lunala#7777

####Steps to reproduce:
- Copy an invite for a server with a long name. 
- Send it in any channel/DM. 
- Observe the number of dots beside the server name.

####Expected result:
It gets truncated with 3 dots like at every other place.
####Actual result:
It gets truncated with just 2 dots which makes it look like the server name gets truncated before the member count in the modal.
####Client settings:
Discord 761
####System settings:
Lenovo vibe K5+, 5.1.1
