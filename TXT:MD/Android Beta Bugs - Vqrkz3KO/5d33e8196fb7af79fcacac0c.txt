Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Be admin in a server that reached boost level 3 and that doesn't have a Vanity URL yet 
- Go to Server Settings > Vanity URL 
- Set the URL of your choice 
- Notice there's no Save button 
- Go back and return to Vanity URL menu: it wasn't saved

####Expected result:
There should be a Save button available after inputting a Vanity URL
####Actual result:
No save button shows up and going back just discards what you typed. A workaround is to press Enter on your keyboard to trigger the save, but there should still be a Save button as it isn't explicit at all and other parts of the app have it
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 9.1.7
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 9.0
