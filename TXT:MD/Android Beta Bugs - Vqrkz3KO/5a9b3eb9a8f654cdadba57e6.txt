[Archived] When you scroll up very slowly through a channel with a lot of images, sometimes you will suddenly be shooted back down by a few messages (https://trello.com/c/sJ97jFYH)

P3 - Will be fixed eventually,

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a channel with a chat history full of images (in my case a #memes channel) 
- Scroll up very slowly. Personnally I stop scrolling for 5 seconds per image so I have time to see/read them and laugh a bit on them (if they are dank memes) 
- Continue for a few minutes, you should start observing it soon after the "you are viewing older messages" appears.

####Expected result:
You should be able to continue reading your memes without interruption
####Actual result:
Sometimes you get throwed back by 20-30 messages, forcing you to scroll up like crazy to retrieve the latest meme you were viewing
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.3.1
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0

### Went through months of images in the blobs starboard, still could not reproduce. There was no jumping back, not even minor stuttering. - Jared on 2018-04-23T22:19:46.874Z
