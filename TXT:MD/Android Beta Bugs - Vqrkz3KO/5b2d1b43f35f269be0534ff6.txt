Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to Server Settings > Channels OR Server Settings > Roles 
- Tap and hold a channel/role to move it. If you're in channel settings you must select the text channel sorting mode first 
- Move the channel up and down, keep doing that back and forth at a decent speed without releasing finger, and while you're doing that, have someone else delete the channel/role. It won't work if the channel/role isn't moving while it's being deleted

####Expected result:
Sorting action simply cancels
####Actual result:
Discord crashes
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.9.6
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
