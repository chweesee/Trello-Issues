####Steps to reproduce:
- Ask a friend who can manage channels in a server 
- Tell them to add a user(you) permission overwrite to a voice channel 
- Let them deny your permissions to Connect 
- Click on the VC 
- Click on the greyed out Channel Locked bar

####Expected result:
A toast saying something along the lines of "You do not have permission to access this channel."
####Actual result:
A toast referring to roles even though it is a user permission overwrite, which is "Your role does not have permission to access this channel."
####Client settings:
