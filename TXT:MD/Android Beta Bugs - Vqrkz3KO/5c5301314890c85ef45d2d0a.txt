### Should also note that backup codes do not work either, since the original suspicion was that the full keyboard opened for  the code backup. However this was not the case and did not accept backup codes, and there is not a toast or any form of message to indicate this, though this separate bug is already marked under https://trello.com/c/D5wCRpYK/
