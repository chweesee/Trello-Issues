Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- In any server, tap Search 
- Input any filter followed by a content (e.g `in:#channel mycontent`) 
- After submitting search, go back and close Search 
- Open Search again. An entry should've been created in the search history. 
- Tap on it 
- Repeat from step 3 through step 5 as many times as you want

####Expected result:
The exact same search should be done each time you repeat step 3-5
####Actual result:
Every new search you make this way will add an extra space between the filter and the content. In this example, the first time it will be `in:#channel mycontent`, the second time `in:#channel  mycontent`, the third time `in:#channel    mycontent`, and so on.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.2.4
####System settings:
