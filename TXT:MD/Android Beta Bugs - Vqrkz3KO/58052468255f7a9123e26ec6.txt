### Can't reproduce.  - Clayton on 2017-07-28T23:36:58.205Z


### Was not able to reproduce with the following steps provided by Xander#0259:

- Receive a rank or everyone mention in a channel you are not currently looking at
- Read the channel with the mention
-Switch out of the channel with the mention (seems to happen most often in channels you don't have typing perms in)
- leave Discord running in the background for a while
- tab back into Discord 
- notice the mention ping is back and doesn't go away

Having someone type in the channel seems to fix the issue - Chris Cox on 2017-10-28T23:33:14.560Z
