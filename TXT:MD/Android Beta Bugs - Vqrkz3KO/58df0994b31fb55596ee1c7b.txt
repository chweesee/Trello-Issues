### Steps to reproduce: - open a users profile - try moving the white circle left or right whilst moving upwards (basically diagonal) - watch as the volume slider has a rave party as discord lags to the point of crashing

### Note that this only seems to happen on specific devices. Does not occur on a Samsung Galaxy S6/7, but does on S4/5 - Jared on 2017-04-10T20:40:15.774Z

### On my phone (RR, 7.1.1) the application hangs until an ANR when I fling the volume slider horizontally. Logs (logcat, ANR traces after several attempts) attached
