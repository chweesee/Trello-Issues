Reported by Lava#9562

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a pretty big server (tested on one with 550 members) with alot of roles, around 15, and that you can manage roles on it 
- Navigate to Server Settings then Roles 
- Get a role, preferably the bottom 
- Violently move the role

####Expected result:
Only the moved role should change its positions and nothing else happens
####Actual result:
Other roles will eventually glitch and change their positions in an unwanted way, sometimes causing a mess
####Client settings:
Android Alpha 6.5.8 (658)
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime ~ Android 7.0 Nougat
