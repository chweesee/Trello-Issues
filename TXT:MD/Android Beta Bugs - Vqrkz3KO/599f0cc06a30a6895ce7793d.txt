### Since Android 8 (Oreo/API 26), all apps targeting the platform must implement the new Notification Channels to be able to send notifications (one channel for all notifications is possible, but it still needs to be implemented manually, there is no default automatic channel). Since Discord since version 4.1 targets Oreo, the platform will not show notifications because it doesn't define Notification Channels.
