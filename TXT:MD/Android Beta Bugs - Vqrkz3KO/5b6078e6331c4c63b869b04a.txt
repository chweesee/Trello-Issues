####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a server where you have the manage channels permission. 
- Click on a channel to edit it. 
- Type a special character such as an ampersant in it's name.

####Expected result:
Like Desktop, you shouldn't be able to even input the "&".
####Actual result:
You are able to input special characters as channel names. When you save your changes, the channel name is set as a hyphen.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 720
