####Steps to reproduce:
- Switch to any channel with different people chatting 
- Change your presence status 
- Immediately close channel drawer and come back to chat 
- Wait up to 10 seconds.

####Expected result:
You change status and nothing strange should happen in chat
####Actual result:
You will notice several strange behavior in chat: Other people's nickname and color in chat will be reset for a split second ; the New Messages banner will disappear if there was one, and if you do this on a channel with a "Welcome to your server" header, this header will disappear for a split second as well. Basically it looks like changing presence status breaks a part of the cache, causing stuff to reload.
