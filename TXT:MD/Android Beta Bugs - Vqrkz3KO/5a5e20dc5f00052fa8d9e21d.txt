Reported by B a â„¢ a n#7883

####Steps to reproduce:
- Get someone to mention you in a server so that you have the red notification badge 
- Long press the server icon 
- Scroll all the way down to sort [server name] and click on it 
- Scroll to the server in which you have been mentioned  
- Observe the notification badge

####Expected result:
You should get a red notification badge that looks as it does normally when viewing the server icon when not sorting servers
####Actual result:
The badge is present but it is embedded into a white background which gives it a white border.
####Client settings:
Android alpha 6.1.0
####System settings:
OnePlus 5, Android 8.0
