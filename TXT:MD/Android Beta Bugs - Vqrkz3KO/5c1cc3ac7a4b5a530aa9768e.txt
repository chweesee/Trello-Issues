### Can reproduce.
Huawei CRR-L09 Android 6.0 Discord 9.9.3, So i have encountered what i was told in the discord is a extension of this bug which causes half of my sub emotes to not work on my phone. So the twitch sub synced server i'm part of have manually added dupes of all the sub emotes so non-subs can use them in the server. On my phone this has caused some of the emotes in the emote menu to have the "-1" ending which causes the emote code to be posted instead of the emote, meaning the emote UI on the phone doesn't work for these sub emotes and i have to manually type them out with the colons ':'. Will get someone to add a pic that better shows what i mean.
