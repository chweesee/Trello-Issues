Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Close Discord 
- Get someone to DM you or mention you, in order to trigger a push notification 
- Open Discord, but don't open the channel you were mentionned in so the push notification is still here 
- Get Discord to crash (you can try to reproduce any crash bug reported recently since build 6.3.5, most of them are still valid in 6.3.6) 
- Re-open Discord, and open the channel you got mentionned in

####Expected result:
The push notification should be dismissed
####Actual result:
The push notification remains and you have to remove it yourself
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.3.6
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0
