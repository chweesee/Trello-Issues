[Archived] (Small visual bug) The white scroll bar in the Members list constantly fades away and re-appears even when the user is not touching it whatsoever. This only appears to happen in larger servers, rather than small ones (https://trello.com/c/UphebOlL)

P3 - Will be fixed eventually,

####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a large server (This one will work fine) 
- Swipe the right side of the screen to open the members 
- Do not touch the screen 
- Wait for a small while as timings seems to differ and observe the white scroll bar fade and reappear without doing anything at all

####Expected result:
Bar should show for a brief second and then simply fade and disappear until user begins to scroll.
####Actual result:
The bar fades away and then reappears without the user touching anything
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.4.6
####System settings:
Motorola Moto G5, Android 7.0

### This ticket was checked during the Trello Cleanup Event and is no longer reproducible as of Android Alpha 7.0.5 on Moto G4 running Android 7.0 because the scrollbar in the member list no longer exists as AndyG has removed it.

Because of this ticket being no longer reproduced, I'm moving it to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-06T19:22:35.527Z
