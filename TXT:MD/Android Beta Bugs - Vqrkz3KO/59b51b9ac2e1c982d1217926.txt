Reported by Polished#6034

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a channel with categories enabled 
- Collapse the bottom most category 
- Scroll down to the bottom of the channel list

####Expected result:
The channel list should show up with some space/padding between the user bar and channel category
####Actual result:
The bottom most category is too close to the user bar and there is no padding between the user bar and category area
####Client settings:
Android Alpha 5.1.4
####System settings:
LG G Stylo, Android 6.0.1

### It seems a kinda-fix was pushed for this, but instead of the intended effect of adding padding to collapsed categories, it added a permanent bar at the bottom of the channel scroller (inc. friends list)
