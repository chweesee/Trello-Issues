### (version 9.7.0) Watch Stream button disabled for users who is live in channel you don't have acces to join. However, It's still enabled for full (5/5 person) channels and still happens (expected result) when you try watch it.

### In my other note I mean:
Disabled -> unable to click 
Enabled -> able to click
