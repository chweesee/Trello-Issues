### Can reproduce.
Samsung Galaxy J7 Android 8.0 | Discord Alpha 6.4.9 | when I updated to 8.0 yesterday, my phone was completely wiped, so I reinstalled discord, and I tried to log in but as soon as I clicked log in the screen dimmed, then the app crashed. Had to leave and rejoin the beta to get it to work. (Please note the above if you encounter this problem otherwise it continues forever)
