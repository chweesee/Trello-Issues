Reported by Aimarekin#3063

####Steps to reproduce:
- Hold your finger on the DMs button (Add friends also works) 
- The device will slightly vibrate like if it was to open a menu like a server, but doesn't

####Expected result:
The device shouldn't vibrate as it won't show any menus
####Actual result:
The device vibrates even if no menu is popped up
####Client settings:
7.4.0
####System settings:
Android 7.0
