Reported by 王劲骢皇帝#1989

####Steps to reproduce:
- Connect to a network connection that specifically has Discord's VoIP service blocked (for me, a public library) 
- Join a Voice Channel of your choice (I was using the server location US West) 
- Wait a few moments, you should get kicked out 
- Go to your notification bar and voila, you can't get rid of it unless you "Force Stop" Discord. (See:  for Video of It)

####Expected result:
Discord should've removed the Call notification when the call was forcibly closed.
####Actual result:
When Discord abruptly closes the call, you cannot remove the notification.
####Client settings:
Android Discord Version 6.0.5
####System settings:
ASUS Nexus 7 2013 v6.0.1 ()

### Still cannot reproduce. The information provided during the CNR event is not helpful in this case as neither the ticket nor the people who said they can reproduce the issue mention anything about a VPN.

And even if they did that would just invalidate the bug, not make it reproducible. - Jared on 2018-04-23T22:01:31.333Z


### Can reproduce.
Galaxy Tab S2, Android Alpha: 6.7.4
