[Archived] When you receive an invite for a group DM you are/were not a part of, the invite modal shows no group name or group icon. It shows the online membercount for some reason but even that is always 0 no matter what. Joining the group DM fixes it. (https://trello.com/c/cxOQKPVz)

P3 - Will be fixed eventually,
