####Steps to reproduce:
- Switch to light theme. 
- Join a VC. 
- Move out of the server you joined the VC in. 
- Observe the voice icon upon the server icon.

####Expected result:
It is in dark theme because the channel drawer and member list are still unthemed.
####Actual result:
The icon is white in colour.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 740
####System settings:
Lenovo vibe K5+, 5.1.1

### The fact that https://trello.com/c/jwElvpkm and https://trello.com/c/wuux9ZVu are bug that got to Trello both of which are confirmed by Jethro makes me think that even this shouldn't adapt theme.
