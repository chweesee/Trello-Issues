[Archived] When a server has the "Must be a member for atleast 10 minutes verification" (and the time is not completed yet) and you go to a channel where someone is typing, the typing indicator doesn't come up like it used to in earlier versions. (https://trello.com/c/RHBC9tHF)

P3 - Will be fixed eventually,

Reported by The Lunala#7777

####Steps to reproduce:
- Join a server which has 10 minutes verification on. 
- Open any channel in it. 
- Ask someone to type in the channel.

####Expected result:
The typing indicator appears because there's enough space for it.
####Actual result:
The typing indicator doesn't appear and messages appear out of nowhere. This also happens with phone number verification thing.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 848
####System settings:
Lenovo Vibe K5+, 5.1.1
