### I think I've identified the issue, and have a workaround for now.

Issue: when the "builder" characters are fused, our autocomplete text doesn't get the notification of the new fused character. This means that we are matching, say `a + e` instead of `ae`. 

Workaround: hit space to cancel autocomplete, then backspace, and the matcher should work again. - Sam Shih on 2020-02-06T22:12:28.866Z


### i believe I have a fix for this in the next release 1035+. Additionally did some micro optimizations and other bugfixes for performance of autocomplete. - Sam Shih on 2020-02-07T22:33:02.303Z
