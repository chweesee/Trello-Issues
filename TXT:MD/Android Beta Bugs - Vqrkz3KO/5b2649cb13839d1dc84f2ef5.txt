####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Discord and toggle split screen mode. 
- Resize Discord so that it occupies 1/3rd (minimum) size of the screen and tap on it to focus the Discord app. 
- Slide from left to right, to open side panel and click on quick switcher icon at the bottom. 
- Notice the keyboard pops up, close it using navigation back button on your device. 
- Now at the end, resize Discord to 1/2 screen size (occupying half of the screen) while the quick switcher is open and keyboard closed. 
- Retry from step one if you don't get it at the first time.

####Expected result:
Quick switcher should adjust itself to size of Discord app while in split screen mode.
####Actual result:
Quick switcher leaves an empty space at the bottom ONLY when doing the reproducible steps above accurately!
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.9.5
####System settings:
Xiaomi Mi A1, Android 8.0.0
