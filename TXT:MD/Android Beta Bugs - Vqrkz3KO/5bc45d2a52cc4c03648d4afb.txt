Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create two channels: one with very short name, another one with very long name 
- Go to the settings of the short channel 
- Add an override for a role 
- Observe there is an offset next to the role name 
- Go back and add an override on the long channel 
- Observe the offset isn't here anymore. For this to work, you need to make sure the long channel name displays on two lines

####Expected result:
Equal offset regardless of the channel name length
####Actual result:
Extra padding is present for short names, no padding for long names
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.7.0
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
