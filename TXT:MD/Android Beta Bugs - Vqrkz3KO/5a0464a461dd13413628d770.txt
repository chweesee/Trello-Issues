####Actual result:
it doesn't, the number stays. reacting again doesn't changes anything

Discord 5.6.1
####System settings:
Huawei P8Lite Android 6.0

### Even if this was a bug initially, and even if this still happens, it's intentionally destructive behavior and isn't worth investing resources into fixes. - Jared on 2018-03-23T22:00:16.848Z
