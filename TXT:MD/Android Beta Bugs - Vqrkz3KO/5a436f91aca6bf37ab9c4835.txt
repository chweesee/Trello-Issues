### Can reproduce.
This bug was valid, and had occured on Android Alpha 5.9.3. It has been since 5.9.5, and seems to be that way for 5.9.7 according to Tonkku. Pushing this bug to Trello so it can be taken care for archival reasoning, since it has been fixed pretty much.

### I missed a word. But, it has been fixed since Alpha 5.9.5, and seems to be doing fine in Alpha 5.9.7 according to Tonkku. Just wanted to point it out.
