### I can't reproduce as written. What I'm seeing is that if you type `@` you'll see the autocomplete menu with whomever.

If, while the autocomplete menu is still up, you switch servers, the autocomplete menu from the first ever still appears.

I have NOT been able to get this into a state where typing `@` shows the autocomplete menu for the wrong server. - Jared on 2016-12-20T22:37:43.012Z
