Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to any channel 
- Tap Search. You can also use the search bar in Quick switcher  
- Tap Enter key on your keyboard

####Expected result:
It should either submit search or not work at all according to another bug I reported before
####Actual result:
You can create a new line within the search bar (the text seems to disappear but when you press delete key the text is back)
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.2.8
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0

### A fix to this bug has been made in 6.2.9, but the Enter key still doesn't submit search, it just loses focus from the searchbar. So we are kinda back to this issue, the only difference is that the Enter key has now the correct symbol: https://trello.com/c/UG3NP05Ym
