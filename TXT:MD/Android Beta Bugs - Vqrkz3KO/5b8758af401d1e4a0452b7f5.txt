Reported by イスラヌブ#2222

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to Settings > My account and then click to change your profile picture. 
- Select an unsupported file format (I used mp4) and observe.

####Expected result:
It pops out an error saying "Unable to open file: Bad activity[...]" for enough time to let you read it.
####Actual result:
The error is shown for around one second or less, touching the screen will show the same error again. (NOTE: only works if you have Google Autofill enabled and with an active suggestion on your screen, got confirmation from a Developer this can be reported)
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.4.0
####System settings:
Honor 9, Android 8.0.0
