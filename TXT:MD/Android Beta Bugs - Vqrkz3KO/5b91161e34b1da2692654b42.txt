####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a channel and open search. 
- Try to scroll up in the page and observe the point from which the semicircular thing comes. 
- Now, search something. 
- again, try to scroll up in the page (while staying at the top) and observe the point from which the semicircular thing comes.

####Expected result:
When you search something, the semicircle still comes from a bit of space below the search box.
####Actual result:
The semicircle comes directly from the search box.
