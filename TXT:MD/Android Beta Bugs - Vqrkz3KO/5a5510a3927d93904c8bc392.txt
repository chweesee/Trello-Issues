Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:

- Have user A on Desktop with everyone perms, and user B on Android, both users on same server but viewing different channels 
- User A sends an @ everyone 
- User B reads the ping and goes back to a different channel 
- User B restarts Discord by killing the app from Recent Tasks and reopens it 
- Have user A edit his message containing the everyone tag

####Expected result:
Ping shouldn't remain stuck in anyway
####Actual result:
You are in a situation where channel has no unreads but still has a ping indicator. This ping is persistent : it cannot be removed unless you view it on Desktop or wait for new messages to be sent in this channel. Restarting Discord or even clearing the cache doesn't remove it.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.0.6
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0

### Can reproduce.
Parts of that bug seem to be fixed, but not everything. So here's what I did: Discord was fully closed on my phone, I read the announcement for the new Alpha (6.3.5), updated the app and opened it. Jethro thinks it might have something to do with the role being made mentionable and unmentionable again.

### I slightly edited this report so it no longer references https://trello.com/c/6DLWMeYC/ , as I figured out that those are not related to each other
