### should be easy fix. And we def want people to be able to say no... - Sam Shih on 2018-02-25T11:46:20.438Z


### Fix to have buttons always displayed. However multi-window mode is unsupported so the visuals are still a bit jank in that case. You'll still be able to see the option though. - Sam Shih on 2018-02-27T19:45:10.361Z
