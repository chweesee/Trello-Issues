####Steps to reproduce:
- Open "User Settings" 
- Go to "Language" 
- Enable "Sync Across Clients" 
- Select a language different from English. (On both phone and desktop it should update) 
- Deselect "Sync Across Clients" (Go check Desktop it should stay as the synced language even after restarting)

In this case once a user deselects "Sync Across Clients" the language should reset to original.
####Actual result:
Following the steps can result into a flaw in the system which doesn't re-roll the language.
