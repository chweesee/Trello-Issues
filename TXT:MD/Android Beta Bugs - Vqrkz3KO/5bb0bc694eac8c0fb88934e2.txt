Reported by The Lunala#7777

####Steps to reproduce:
- Get the connection problems in app notification. 
- Click on any of the links (server status or @discordapp). 
- Close the custom Chrome tab (or go back to the app if you're not using the custom Chrome tab). 
- Observe the timer on the notification.

####Expected result:
The timer continues.
####Actual result:
The timer goes all the way to the end and gets stuck there which causes the notification to not close at all.
####Client settings:

####System settings:
