####Steps to reproduce:

- Prerequisite: you have been on Discord for quite some time and have already visited a few active channels during this session 
- Turn on airplane mode to simulate a temporary connection loss. If you have a very bad/slow connection, this step might not even be required. 
- Switch to one of the channels you previously visited 
- Find a message in chat from a user that is uncached, i.e that doesn't have their role color, server nickname and pfp loaded. If you can't find any, try another channel, and make sure new users are constantly sending new messages in those channels  
- Long press the message of the uncached user 
- On the message action sheet, click Profile (or the avatar). If the profile appears completely blank, you're good to go 
- Wait 5-10 seconds

####Expected result:
You should stay in the user profile screen until the profile loads eventually
####Actual result:
If the user profile still haven't loaded after 5-10 seconds, you will automatically be taken back to chat
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 8.5.5
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
