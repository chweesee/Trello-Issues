Reported by Hole#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to audit log, and scroll down until you have to load more. 
- As soon as it reaches the end, you should see that it just stops without any loading. From there, scroll down for more immediately (need to be fast)

####Expected result:
Once you scroll down enough, loading animation should appear automatically and load more logs.
####Actual result:
After you scroll down, it seems like you hit the end, and loading animation starts only when you attempt to scroll down more from that end.
####Client settings:
Alpha 7.6.8
####System settings:
LG Fortune, Android 6.0.1
