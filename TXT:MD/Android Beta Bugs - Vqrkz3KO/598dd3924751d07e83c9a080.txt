Reported by Symplyfyed#4913

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a server where you can change Nicknames and there's people that have some 
- Go to settings, then to members, select one with a nickname, and delete the nick. 
- Observe that after the field is empty the save button doesn't appear 
- (optional) add a space then observe that the save button appears 
- (optional) press the save button, and observe the wrong confirmation message saying the nick was changed to "." 
- (optional) press the "go back" arrow (try to exit from user settings 
- go to another user). Observe that a message appears saying the changes were not saved even if you pressed the save button before.

####Expected result:
You should be able to delete the nickname and then press the save button - You shouldn't have a message saying some changes were not saved - You shouldn't have a confirmation message saying the nick was changed to "." when it was reseted.
####Actual result:
Everything is broken about Nicknames. You cannot reset the nickname without adding a space in the empty field of "change Nickname". Also doing so, the app thinks that the changes were not saved, even if you pressed the save button
####Client settings:

### Long Description: The nickname field is buggy. If you try to delete the nickname, then press the save button, you observe that the save button doesn't appear. To reset Nicknames you need to add a space. When pressing save it says the nickname was charged to "." but it's wrong, because the nick was reseted. Also when trying to press the go back button says some changes were not saved, even if you pressed the save button before
