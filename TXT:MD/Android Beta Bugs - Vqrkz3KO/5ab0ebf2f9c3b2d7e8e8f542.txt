### Can't reproduce.
Samsung Galaxy S7, Android 7.0, Discord Alpha 6.3.9. This bug appears to only be affecting some devices, as raw mention format works fine for me. The exclamation point you added in your raw format is also not correct format.

### Can reproduce.
Samsung Galaxy S7, Android 7.0, Discord Alpha 6.3.9. After a second round of testing, raw mention format for users appears to be failing. Channel format still works, though.
