### @jared627 When i reported this I had no one to talk to so I couldnt test to see if it actually affects the ability to speak, the icons desyncing is more what I was trying to report. This can probably be archived if there is a report for the icons desyncing and going wild. - Cole Norman on 2016-11-02T17:36:32.442Z
