Reported by The Lunala#7777

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Audit log of any server. 
- Click on a (preferably long) expandable entry. [Keep on doing this again and again (expand and collapse) with almost no intervals to observe the bug most clearly].

####Expected result:
Like on desktop, all the entries below the one you clicked get pushed down and then the entry expands.
####Actual result:
The clicked entry first expands under the entry next to it and then all entries get pushed.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 755
####System settings:
