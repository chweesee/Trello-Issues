####Steps to reproduce:
- Revoke permissions from Discord to use microphone and camera 
- Go to a DM with someone 
- First, select "Start voice call". When Discord requests microphone access, an error toast will show up if you choose Refuse.  
- Now do the same but with "Start video call" instead: when it requests access to camera/microphone choose Refuse

####Expected result:
Same error toast as for regular voice call
####Actual result:
No error toast at all
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.5.6
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0
