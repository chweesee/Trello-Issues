####Steps to reproduce:
- Click and hold on the Voice Channel to copy its ID (you need to have the Developer Mode enabled, to do that go to Settings > Behavior > Developer Mode). 
- Paste the ID in a Text Channel using this format: `<#idHere>` and then send it. 
- Click on the Channel tag and observe.

####Expected result:
Discord connects to the Voice Channel and leaves you on the Channel where you sent the message.
####Actual result:
Discord connects to the Voice Channel, but it takes you to the top, or sometimes a random, Text Channel.
####Client settings:
Android Alpha 7.3.8
####System settings:
Honor 9, Android 8.0.0

### Per https://trello.com/c/xu5rbIre the fact that you're able to join a voice channel this way shouldn't be possible in the first place. So this isn't really a valid bug

### The Trello in https://trello.com/x/xu5rbIre has just been updated and moved to Won't Fix and now it's considered Not A Bug since it's an unintended feature that will be kept. This bug is now valid.
