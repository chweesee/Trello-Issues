Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Join any voice channel with a friend. If you're alone and have no friends, you can use a music bot instead 
- Have your friend speak in the vc, or play a song using the bot 
- While you're listening to your friend/the song, go to the **general** voice settings (not channel settings or user profile) 
- Try to move the output volume slidebar

####Expected result:
The volume should be adjusted according to the value/position of the slidebar
####Actual result:
Nothing happens, volume stays unchanged
####Client settings:
Discord Android Alpha 5.2.7
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0
