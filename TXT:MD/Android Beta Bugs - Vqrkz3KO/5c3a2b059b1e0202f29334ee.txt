####Steps to reproduce:
- Launch Spotify and play a song. 
- Open Discord and navigate to a DM, type a message so you can quickly view your profile later, and close the Discord app, and clear it from your recent apps. 
- Reopen Discord (you should still be on the DM) and quickly long press on your avatar in the DM to view your profile, before your profile shows that you're online. 
- When you appear online and shows that you're listening to Spotify, the album title will sit behind the song duration bar, instead of above the song duration bar where it is supposed to go. 
- Tapping out of your profile and going back into it fixes it.

####Expected result:
The album title should sit above the duration bar.
####Actual result:
The album title sits behind the duration bar.
####Client settings:
Android Alpha 8.2.7
####System settings:
Google Pixel 2 XL, Android Pie (January 2019 Update)
