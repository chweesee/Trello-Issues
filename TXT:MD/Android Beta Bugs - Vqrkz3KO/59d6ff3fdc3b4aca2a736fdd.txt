Reported by Striker#7250

####Steps to reproduce:-Make a server and add a few roles
-Make sure one of them is higher in permission than the others
-Organise them and maybe colour them
-Give yourself and a friend some roles, in different orders. E.g: Give them Mod, then Admin, then Member.
-Notice one of the roles goes to the front of the list when it's not at the top of the roles

####Expected result:
The roles should display in order
####Actual result:
they display in a random order
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha  5.2.7
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy S8, Android 7.0
