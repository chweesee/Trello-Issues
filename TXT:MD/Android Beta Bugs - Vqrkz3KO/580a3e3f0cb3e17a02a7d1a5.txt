### Cannot reproduce.  Avatar changes without problem.

I find it likely that what happened was this user was logged in on their phone, then changed the password (or something similar) on desktop, which auto logs you out of every other platform.  When trying to take an action after that, the app finally updated and kicked him out. - Jared on 2016-10-24T21:35:14.927Z
