Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open both Desktop and Android clients 
- On both clients, go to Server Settings > Overview 
- On Desktop, change the server region into something else with a different flag, and save the changes 
- Observe on Android 
- If it didn't work, press the Save button on Android and then re-click Save button on Desktop

####Expected result:
Either nothing updates retroactively and does nothing else besides showing the save button, or the name of the region should update along with the flag icon
####Actual result:
The flag icon updates but not the name, so you have a flag that doesn't match with the name
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.4.8
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
