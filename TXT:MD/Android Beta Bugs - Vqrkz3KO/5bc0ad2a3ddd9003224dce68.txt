Reported by M45T3R5W4G3R#8553

####Steps to reproduce:
- Connect to any voice channel on Android, 
- Accept an ongoing phone call/make a phone call, 
- People in the voice channel can hear all you say and hear through you, 
- Also Discord's voice channel sound management is treated as a "call" type rather than "media" so it's minimum possible voice is still too high and requires one to lower every person's voice level around to 30% one by one; this "call" type treatment is probably the reason Discord doesn't get suppressed by the phone call and interferes it.

####Expected result:
I should have been auto-disconnected or muted/deafened or had another way that disables Discord activity on our side.
####Actual result:
All our and our caller's voices are being broadcasted onto voice channel, also other people interfere our phone call.
####Client settings:
7.6.5 (765)
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 10 Lite, Android 8.0.0
