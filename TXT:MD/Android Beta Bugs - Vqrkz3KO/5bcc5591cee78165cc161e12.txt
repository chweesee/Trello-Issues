Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a channel with slowmode enabled (make sure you're not immune to it) 
- Send a large file, then send a bunch of message immediately after so they are queued behind the file 
- Wait for the file to finish uploading

####Expected result:
Either the app shouldn't let you send more messages until file is uploaded, or the messages should stay queued until the slowmode cooldown is over
####Actual result:
When the file finishes uploading, the slowmode starts and then all of the queued messages attempt to send, resulting in all of them failing to send and turning red at once
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.7.8
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
