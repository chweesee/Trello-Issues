### No special steps were taken. Just used discord built-in camera OR native android camera to take a portrait oriented photo, and post to chat. Image will be horizontal.

### Can't reproduce.
Discord Alpha 5.8.0, Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0. I tried everything: in-app camera, native camera... But the picture still sends in correct orientation for me. Maybe it's because my phone has a dual camera.
