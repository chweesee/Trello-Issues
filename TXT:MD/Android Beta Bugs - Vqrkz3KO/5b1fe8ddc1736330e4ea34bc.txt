Reported by The Lunala#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Type something that exceeds 2k characters. 
- Seed it in some channel on DTesters (because that's the only server where message sharing is released). 
- Long press on the message. 
- Observe.

####Expected result:
There should be no option to share the because the message hasn't been sent.
####Actual result:
There's an option to share the message. If you click on your shared link, you are redirected to your message (in red) but if someone else clicks, they're taken to the channel and the "You are viewing older messages" appears.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 689
####System settings:
Lenovo vibe K5+, 5.1.1
