####Steps to reproduce:-go to Server setting.
-click on members list under user management.
-click on the roles filter box right to the members search bar (note that you should make a role with a long name,like"HEILDABBITOURMEMELORDSqUad2k17") :P

####Expected result:
the role should be shown just fine ,the box should expand that it can show the largest role without getting cut off.
####Actual result:
role name gets cut off.
