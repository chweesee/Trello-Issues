### From my PR:
```
Bug: we were consuming and updating the spoiler state when the user clicked on the spoiler overlay in the pinned messages view. We however (intentionally) don't update the pinned messages view so there's no user feedback.
The correct behaviour, as is also on desktop, is to just jump the user to the appropriate message in the chat view.
