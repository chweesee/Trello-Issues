Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to your mobile data settings of your Android device and select option to force 2G. This is the best way to simulate a weak connection.  
- Open Server Settings > Channels 
- Select either text or voice sorting mode (personally it occured more often when sorting voice channels, but that might be just me)  
- Try to sort several channels successively by moving them into different categories. Try to be as quick as possible (without making it a destructive behavior either) : move another channel as soon as you released your finger to move a channel

####Expected result:
The client should queue your actions properly, so everything is sorted fine at the end, even if you have to wait for quite a while since your internet is slow
####Actual result:
The client tries to do everything at the same time and may produce conflicts, causing weird toasts to appear such as "only one channel can have a parent_id modified at a time". Usually when those errors show up your channels won't be sorted properly at the end
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.9.6
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
