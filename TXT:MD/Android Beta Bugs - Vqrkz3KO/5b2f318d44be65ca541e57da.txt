####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to Settings > Appearance 
- Change the theme to the opposite colour 
- Press the back button (rather native or in-app) immediately 
- Observe how some UI components don't update: settings page and message flow take a few seconds.

####Expected result:
The UI components should change theme immediately
####Actual result:
The UI components take a few seconds to change, and it quite obvious if moving quickly
####Client settings:
Android Alpha 6.9.9
####System settings:
Nokia 7 Plus running Android 8.1.0

### I've checked this ticket during the Trello Cleanup event as it was suggested that it may be an extension of https://trello.com/c/fplttq0x/529-light-mode-flashes-dark-before-loading-light . I do agree that it is an extension because of the different reproduction steps, but the same end result (where there is a delay of the theme change before it processes.)

Because of this ticket being an extension, I will be archiving this ticket. - Ghoul on 2018-07-06T02:27:30.720Z
