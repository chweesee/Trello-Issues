####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to any server having a voice channel 
- Click on the voice channel name to open up that channel screen, notice the new blurple button on the bottom saying "connect to voice" on it. 
- Notice the font color is black, now join the vc and in the voice settings select "push to talk" , go back and notice the button on the bottom saying "push to talk" with a white font written on.

####Expected result:
The text "connect to voice" Should have white text
####Actual result:
The text "connect to voice" has black text (incorrect) on it.
