Reported by RME#3050

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have two channels in which messages have been posted by users you blocked (the messages don't have to be from the same user; for the best result make sure the blocked messages are a little bit up) 
- Switch from channel A to B 
- Observe your position in the chat

####Expected result:
Your position in chat should still be at the bottom as you've already caught up with everything.
####Actual result:
You're being jumped back to the earliest blocked message that has been loaded by the app.
####Client settings:
Alpha 6.4.4
####System settings:
OnePlus 3T Android O (8.0.0)
