####Steps to reproduce:
- Select a song on Spotify and wait for it to appear on Discord. 
- Select a song that is added to Spotify through Local Files, and check the presence again.

####Expected result:
It should show up as the custom song playing.
####Actual result:
The previous song shows to be playing (and will disappear after a while). If no song was chosen before it, the presence will appear as if no song is playing.
####Client settings:
Android Alpha 8.2.4
####System settings:
Android 8.0
