####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a new server or open an existing one that you haven't accepted the NSFW 18+ prompt in yet 
- Ensure only one text channel exists 
- Send at least one message if the channel is empty 
- Edit the channel and mark it as NSFW 
- Exit the channel settings and make sure you see the 18+ prompt (but don't press continue) 
- Go back into the channel settings and delete the channel 
- Observe the message view

####Expected result:
The view is empty and doesn't contain any messages because there are no text channels
####Actual result:
Despite showing "No Text Channels" in the title bar, the contents of the now deleted NSFW channel are displayed
####Client settings:
31-alpha2 (1196)
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy S10+, Android 10
