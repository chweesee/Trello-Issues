####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to quickswitcher, and type some gibberish stuffs in there that will give no results. 
- First, hit the "Add Friend" button. See how your gibberish content transfers over. 
- Then, hit the back button, and press on "Join a server". 
- Observe how your content doesn't transfer over.

####Expected result:
Your search content should transfer over, like "Add Friend" option.
####Actual result:
It doesn't transfer over, and it stays empty.
####Client Settings:
Discord Alpha 7.8.8
####System settings:
LG Fortune, Android 6.0.1

### I personally think this is intended. When you search for a user and don't find it, you may want to add the user you typed as friend, the input transferring over would allow you to save time typing out the DiscordTag. But in the case of server, that doesn't make sense, as you need to input the server invite code, not the server name.
