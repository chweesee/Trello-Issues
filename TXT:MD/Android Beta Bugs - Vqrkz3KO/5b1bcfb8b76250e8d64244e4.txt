Reported by fujhofn.#0003

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to: Server settings> Member > Choose a member. 
- Scroll down until you see button for ban and kick. 
- Try ban or kick the client.

####Expected result:
When we ban/kick the client, we auto-leave the "pannel server" of the member.
####Actual result:
We stay on the "server panel" of the member and we can transfer ownership/ban again/kick again.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.8.9
####System settings:
Huawei P8Lite 2016, Emui 4.1 â€¢ Android 6.0.1
