### Can reproduce.
CR Samsung Galaxy S6, 7.0, 562 can assign roles to people even without the perms to do so

### Can reproduce.
CR, the role list does appear, but when you tap on a checkbox to try to assign/remove a role to someone, nothing happens. By the way, people with no permissions at all except 'Kick' or 'Ban' can access the Members section of the server settings, because the kick and ban options were missing on the mini-profile card in older versions, but now this is not useful anymore I guess.
