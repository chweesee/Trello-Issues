Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to Audit Logs 
- Tap Filter by actions or user 
- Tap the textfield. Notice how the panel extends to fullscreen when keyboard opens 
- Type nonsense stuff in the search bar so it gives no results (or write something that gives only 2 or 3 results, works as well) 
- Close the keyboard 
- Attempt to make the panel fullscreen again (swipe up, reopen keyboard, etc)

####Expected result:
Regardless of whether there are search results or not, opening the keyboard must expand the panel in fullscreen
####Actual result:
You can't expand the panel neither by reopening keyboard nor swiping up
