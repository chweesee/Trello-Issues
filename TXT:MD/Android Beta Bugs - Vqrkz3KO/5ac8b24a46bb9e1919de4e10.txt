Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to Friends list 
- Tap "Add friends to Group DM" 
- Focus user search bar 
- Type in letters so that the very first user showing up isn't the same as when the searchfield is empty 
- Clear the search textfield

####Expected result:
You should stay at the top of the user list, because technically you never scrolled down
####Actual result:
You are still at the position of the user you searched for
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.4.6
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0
