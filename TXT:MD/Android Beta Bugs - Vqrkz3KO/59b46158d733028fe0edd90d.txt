Reported by Symplyfyed#4913

####Steps to reproduce:
- Make a server with a few categories and channels 
- Edit a category  
- Go to the permissions tab 
- Observe the top bar saying "channel settings" instead of "category settings" 
- Press add a role/a member 
- Observe the permissions that you can manage. Some are missing. For example you cannot the category private (don't let a role see it) 
- Optional see attachments

####Expected result:
The top bar and the permissions from the permissions tab should make reference to category/category settings. Also there should be the same permissions as on desktop (when adding a role/member and trying to manage the perms).
####Actual result:
The top bar some permissions from the permissions tab, makes reference to channel settings. And also some permissions are missing. For example you cannot set as a role to can't see a category (can't make the category private)
####Client settings:
Alpha 5.1.4
####System settings:
Android 4.4.4, Tablet Allview VIVAH8LTE
