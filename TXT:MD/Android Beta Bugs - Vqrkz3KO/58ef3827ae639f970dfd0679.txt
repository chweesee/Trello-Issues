### Will be fixed in 3.6.6 release. - Andy Garron on 2017-04-14T18:37:18.453Z


### This is 'fixed', but can still be reproduced by desktop and mobile users working together with the following steps:

Have a desktop user add reactions to the pin alert with the right-click menu, they will show up on mobile but not on desktop.

Afterwards android users can click on these like normal reaction emojis. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-04-18T10:59:53.962Z


### Spoke to Andy about this, the behaviour described below is a bug on the desktop's part. He asked me to report it to the Canary bug section. Will do this today. So this is fixed. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-04-21T13:00:58.983Z
