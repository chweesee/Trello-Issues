### @lytefast with this being 5.x only I suspect it has to do with switching the `SimpleDraweeSpanTextView` to extend `AppCompatTextView`.

I'll keep my eye out for other bugs that may be related, til then this is a won't fix (it's either this or the fonts -- we'll never find the time to PR to fresco just to fix 5.x phones). - Andy Garron on 2018-04-19T17:59:07.531Z

### If it helps Andy, I've been able to reproduce since 641, not sure about older versions
