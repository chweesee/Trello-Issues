####Steps to reproduce:
- You need 2 accounts or assistance from a friend to reproduce this.  
- Send a message and tell your friend to add 4(or n) reactions to it.  
- Tap and hold on the message then tap Reactions.  
- Select any reaction tab except the 1st one (say 3rd) and keep viewing it.  
- Tell your friend to remove the reaction that you are viewing it (in this case 3rd) 
- You will get switched to the first tab.  
- Tell your friend to add the same reaction that he removed.  
- Observe how the tab switches.

####Expected result:
When he removes the reaction, you should be switched to the 1st reaction tab and upon adding the same reaction, you should continue to stay on the 1st reaction tab.
####Actual result:
When the reaction is removed, you get switched to the 1st tab, when the same reaction is added you get switched back to the former reaction tab.
