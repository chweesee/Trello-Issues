####Steps to reproduce:
- Head to a channel 
- Change the channel name to one with spaces ex. "channel test" 
- Press Save 
- Observe 
- Exit the Channel Settings 
- Observe

####Expected result:
There should be some type of error message saying that you can't have a channel with spaces or the channel name should change and the save button should go away.
####Actual result:
The save button stays there and it says the channel name successfully changed when it hasn't.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 8.2.2
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy S8+, Android 8.0.0
