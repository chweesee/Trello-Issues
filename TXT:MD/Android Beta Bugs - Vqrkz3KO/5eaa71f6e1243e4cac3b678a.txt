### Can reproduce.
Moto G7, Android 9, Discord 20.2 (1122). Switching to a different channel before deletion causes bug to not occur; not switching back to the first channel before deleting causes bug to not occur (but after you do, you can switch between them as much as you want); if you do three channels with the same draft, only the recent two will be deleted
