###  I can still reproduce this on OnePlus 5 Android 8.1 with Discord Alpha 7.4.8. Though with different reproduction steps.

 - Get mentioned in a NSFW channel
 - Enter recent mentions then press on the mention
 - Click nope on the NSFW warning 
 - Observe how the NSFW channel is merged with your friend list on the same screen.

Also when testing this bug, please keep in mind that this bug https://trello.com/c/ljH1kZi0 breaks the nope button, So this must be tested on an older channel. (33x snowflake or less). Reopening ticket. - Tarek on 2018-09-10T15:17:55.426Z

### Can reproduce.
Can reproduce when the nsfw content channel is on the top of the channel list. Alpha 7.8.6 Samsung Galaxy S7, Android 8.0.0

### Can reproduce.
Discord Alpha 7.8.6, Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0. The NSFW channel needs to be the topmost channel of the server for this to occur. Otherwise you get redirected to the top channel of the server instead of the friends list.

### Can reproduce.
