Reported by PLAYERUNKNOWN#6372

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a long name as mine. 
- Open the channel drawer. 
- Observe the place where your name is.

####Expected result:
It should either show it as my full name (i.e. PLAYERUNKNOWN) or a part of it followed by 3 dots (i.e. PLAYERUN...).
####Actual result:
It shows only half of letter 'N'. This only seems to happen on small screened devices.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.0.8
####System settings:
Coolpad Mega 3, Android 6.1
