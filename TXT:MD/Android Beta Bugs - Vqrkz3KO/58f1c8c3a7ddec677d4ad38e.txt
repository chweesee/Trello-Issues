####Steps to reproduce: 
- Change your language 
- If the app soft locks, go into Task View then open it again (do not stop the app!!) 
- Check out the Timestamps of messages  

####Expected result:
 Timestamps are translated 
####Actual result:
 Timestamps don't show up translated. Restarting the app fixes it. 
####System settings:
