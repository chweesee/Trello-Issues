Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to Friends tab and open Add Friends screen 
- Input a valid Discord Tag 
- Press Send

####Expected result:
The old Add Friends modal used to close after successfully sending a friend request. In this new screen I believe it is supposed to either close or at least clear the contents of the textfield
####Actual result:
After successfully sending a friend request, everything stay on screen so you can keep pushing the Send button to spam-send the same friend request. This also forces you to manually clear the textfield if you want to input another user
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.2.9
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
