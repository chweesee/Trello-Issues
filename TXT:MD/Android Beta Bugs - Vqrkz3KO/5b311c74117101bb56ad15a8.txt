####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to Create instant invite screen 
- Tap the settings icon 
- Select a different channel in the dropdown menu 
- Select a different channel in the dropdown menu 
- Select a different channel in the dropdown menu 
- Select a different channel in the dr... ok I stop 
- Now go in Server Settings and look at the invite list to notice the results

####Expected result:
Changing channel should not create a new invite until "Generate link" button is pressed
####Actual result:
It immediately creates a new invite as soon as you change the target channel in the dropdown menu, which creates unnecessary invites and you can easily get ratelimited
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.9.9
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
