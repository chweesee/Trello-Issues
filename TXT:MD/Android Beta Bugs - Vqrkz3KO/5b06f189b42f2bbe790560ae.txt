####Steps to reproduce:
- Join a voice channel, mute and deafen yourself. 
- Notice that the backslash symbol over the mic and headphone icon when you see the voice channel without going into it 
- Now go to voice channel screen by clicking the channel name and notice that the slash symbol over the mic and headphone icon

####Expected result:
The mic and headphone icon should be same in both the cases (either backslash or slash symbol running across the mic and headphone icon)
####Actual result:
Icons are different in both the cases
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.7.9
####System settings:
Xiaomi Mi A1, Android 8.0.0
