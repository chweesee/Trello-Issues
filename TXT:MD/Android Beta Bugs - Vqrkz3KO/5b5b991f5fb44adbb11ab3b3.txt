####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure you have the new Add Friends feature (it should look like this:  ). 
- From "Add Friend" (not from "Pending") accept a Friend Request or ask to a friend to send you a friend request and accept it. 
- Once you have accepted the Friend Request you can notice that the button from "Accept" has switched to "Send" instead of "Accepted" or vanished.

####Expected result:
The button should switch to "Accepted" or remove the user from the list.
####Actual result:
The user will stay on the list and Discord will show a "Send" button (which doesn't work).
####Client settings:
7.1.2
####System settings:
Honor 9, Android 8.0
