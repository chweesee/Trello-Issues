Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to Search in a server 
- Choose any filter option (in, from, etc)  
- After the filter is inserted, notice the button to submit the search isn't here yet. I guess this is to prevent ability to submit empty filters 
- ... But you can bypass that by simply adding spaces after the filter colons, like so: `"from:    "`

####Expected result:
The submit button should stay hidden until you put actual text after the filter
####Actual result:
The submit button appears and you can submit an empty filter. Doing so will result in a failed search with a broken manifying glass
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.4.7
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
