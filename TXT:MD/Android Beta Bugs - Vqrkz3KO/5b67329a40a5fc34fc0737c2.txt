####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a big server where you have manage members permission. 
- Click on Server settings>Members. 
- Scroll down through the list with inertia. 
- Observe the profile pictures of people. -

####Expected result:
Either there's an empty space like the server icon in the invite modal or there's Discord's logo like in friends list.
####Actual result:
There's just a blurple placeholder.
