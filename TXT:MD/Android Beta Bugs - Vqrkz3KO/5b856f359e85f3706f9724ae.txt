####Steps to reproduce:
- Have someone to send you a message and click on the notification; you have to close the app from the Android button first and make sure you weren't in the Server where you got the notification. 
- Switch Server and observe the channel, watch the video for any clarification.

####Expected result:
You are in the last channel you've visited (in the Bug Hunters Server for example bug-approval-queue).
####Actual result:
You are taken to the top channel of the Server, this happens to all of your other Servers (for example instead of bug-approval-queue you're in rules).
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.4.0
####System settings:
Honor 9, Android 8.0.0
