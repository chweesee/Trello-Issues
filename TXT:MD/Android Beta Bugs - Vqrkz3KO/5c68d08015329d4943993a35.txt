### Can reproduce.
Can Reproduce - Samsung Galaxy J36V - Alpha 8.4.5G - Android 7.1.1 - Note: I can reproduce this with Admin Perms, Ownership, just having Audit Logs permission, but for some reason, I can not reproduce it in another server that I am in that has Manage Roles, Delete Messages, Display Role Seperately, Allow anyone to mention this role, then the basics, like reading, attaching files, embedding links, sending messages, and sending emotes. I don't know why but that somehow does not make audit logs disappear.
