Reported by Djammiafda#4273

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Join a channel with unread messages. 
- Scroll partially down the channel, without reaching the unread messages at the very bottom. 
- Switch to a different channel. 


####Expected result:
 Unread messages aren't marked off because they've yet to be seen.

####Actual result:
 Whole channel is marked as read, without actually having read them all.
