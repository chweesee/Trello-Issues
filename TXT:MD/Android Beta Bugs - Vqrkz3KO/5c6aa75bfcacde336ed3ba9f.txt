Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to Settings > Conenctions 
- Add > XBox 
- Fill the 6-digit code input with random characters until you get 'invalid code' 
- Place your cursor on the left side of the last character (refer to attachment)  
- Press and hold down the Backspace button of your keyboard for 5-10 seconds

####Expected result:
Nothing should happened (or maybe it's supposed to delete the characters in previous fields, idk)
####Actual result:
The invalid code gets spam-resubmitted at a very fast rate, causing the toast to show for a very long time after stopping and the rate limit to be reached very quickly
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 8.4.8
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
