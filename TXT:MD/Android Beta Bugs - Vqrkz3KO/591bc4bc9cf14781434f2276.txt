####Steps to reproduce:
- Search for messages with invites to other servers (you can search them with "<discord.gg>") and found one (or create them by yourself) 
- Click the message's invite link in search results 
- Click the message to jump to it 
- Click the invite link again 
- Close the search screens and return to normal chat

####Expected result:
You see invitation pop-up right after you clicked the invitation link (in both ways: in search results and in expanded messages)
####Actual result:
Nothing happens in both ways, you will only see the invitation pop-up when you close these search screens and return to normal chat.
