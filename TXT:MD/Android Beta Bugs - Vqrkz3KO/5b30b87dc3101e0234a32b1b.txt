Reported by Ene#0808

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a Channel with a long name (can use the full 100 char limit or just some wide characters like "w") and observe the text field's length

####Expected result:
The Channel's name truncates with "..." to prevent the text field expansion (like on desktop)
####Actual result:
The text field is greatly expanded, being several lines tall if the Channel's name is very long
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.9.9
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy S9 8.0
