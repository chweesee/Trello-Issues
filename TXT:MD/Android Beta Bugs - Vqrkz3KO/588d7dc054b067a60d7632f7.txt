####Steps to reproduce: 
- Have someone in a voice chat 
- See if it has the mic/headphones muted 
- Enter the connect/disconect voice menu. 

####Expected result:
 If someone has mic muted, for example, when you enter the voice chat menu it should show that mic is muted but headphones are on. 
####Actual result:
Mic shows unmuted instead of muted and headphones show muted instead of unmuted. 
####System settings:
 Android 6.0, v 3.2.9

### I am no longer to reproduce this, it's been fixed with the new voice UI - the icons displayed in the voice channel member list are the same as the ones in that voice channel's connect menu.
