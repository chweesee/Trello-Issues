### I do not think this is a 7.1.1 issue. Please do not reopen this ticket and instead use the master ticket. - Jeff Cailteux on 2018-11-26T23:09:16.728Z

### Upon further inspection, I have repro-ed this and determined that the OS simply won't recognize "isGame" functionality on just Android 7.1. Bizarre and probably an oversight from Google, but nonetheless we have to disable this feature on 7.1. - Jeff Cailteux on 2018-11-27T18:42:09.352Z
