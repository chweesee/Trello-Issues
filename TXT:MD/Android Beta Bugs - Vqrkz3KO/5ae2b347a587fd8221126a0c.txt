####Steps to reproduce:
- Put the discord in split screen and reduce even more 
- Click the channel finder icon, the first one in the user, config and mention bar 
- Click the filter and it doesn't scroll

####Expected result:
It should be able to scroll the filter, even if it only have a option and you can make the split screen bigger to solve it. But it can be a little bit worse in smaller screens
####Actual result:
If doesn't let you scroll, you have to make the split screen bigger to choose the last option, I think in smaller screens it get a little bit worse
####Client settings:
Discord Beta 6.5.6
####System settings:
Xiaomi 4X, Android 7.1.2
