####Steps to reproduce:
- Close all other instances of discord to ensure mobile push notifications are sent 
- Ensure Discord is not running in the background by closing it via the app switcher 
- Open the app, type a message in the message box but don't send it 
- Close the app, but ensure it's still running in the background (Home Button, App Switcher, etc.) 
- Receive a push notification in the same channel you originally had a draft in 
- Open the push notification 
- If the draft isn't immediately replaced, the draft gets saved somewhere 
- Type another (different) message in the box but again, don't send it 
- Close out of the app again, ensuring it is running in the background 
- Receive and open another push notification in the same channel as before 
- Observe the message has been replaced 
- Note: This doesn't appear to be 100% consistent in presenting itself. If the draft doesn't get replaced, repeat steps 7 to 11. It should present itself within a few tries 
- See attached YouTube video for a demonstration

####Expected result:
The draft is not overwritten
####Actual result:
The draft gets overwritten occasionally with something else
####Client settings:
Alpha 5.8.6; Only seems to affect Alpha 5.8.4 and newer
####System settings:
Pixel 2 XL Android 8.1
