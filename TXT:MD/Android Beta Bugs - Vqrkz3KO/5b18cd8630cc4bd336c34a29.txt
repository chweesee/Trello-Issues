####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a server entirely marked as read, with a lot of channels 
- Switch to the most active channel in the server  
- Scroll in channel list so the channel is offscreen 
- Look at channel list while new messages are being sent in the channel by other users

####Expected result:
Unread button should never appear for the current channel you're viewing
####Actual result:
It appears for one second each time a message is posted
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.8.8
####System settings:
