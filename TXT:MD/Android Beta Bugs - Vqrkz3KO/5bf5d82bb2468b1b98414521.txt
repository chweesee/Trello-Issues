If you are experiencing the battery drainage due to the game detection, please drop a !canrepro. 

We will need your Android Alpha version, device info, and android OS. As well any additional information that may be relevant to the battery drainage such as how much percentage in x minutes / hours.

So my battery went down from 100% to 50% in a span of 6 hours, which usually never happens (I'm usually at 30% in the end of the whole day). While I'm in school, my phone is locked most of the time, I practically never use it. My guess is that one of the causes of the battery drain is the fact that the game detection service is running even while the phone is locked, which would indeed eat up resources for nothing. I think the service should be running only when we are actively using the phone, and should better be paused when the phone is locked or idle.

Mi A2, Android 9 - Android Alpha 8.3.4g, dropped from 43% to 13% in an hour with phone locked. Also my phone seemed to have warmed in the meantime. Only data active with battery saver enabled, GPS turned off and discord the only app running (locked phone when app open)
