Reported by advaith#9121

####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure a locked text channel (you can access it because of special perms) is muted 
- Open that server but be in a different channel 
- Open the channel drawer and look at the locked muted channel

####Expected result:
The lock will be darker, like the icon and rest of the text (like it is on desktop)
####Actual result:
The lock is the normal color, as if it's not muted. (accidentally self-denied)
####Client settings:
Discord 4.0.8 (503)
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy Tab A 6 (SM-T280), Android Lollipop 5.1.1
