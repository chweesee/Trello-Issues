####Steps to reproduce:
- Have 2FA enabled on your account 
- Be in a server that has Server 2FA enabled & that you have Admin privileges on 
- Add a reaction to a message and then open Reactions and view yours (if the message has multiple reactions, then go to the emoji that you reacted with) 
- Close out of Reactions and go to the server that you have Admin privileges on (if you had went into another server, otherwise just scroll the channel list up) and observe the warning at the top

####Expected result:
No false warning about needing 2FA should be present as you already have it enabled
####Actual result:
A warning telling you that you need 2FA enabled re-appears on all your servers you moderate with Server 2FA enabled on
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.4.8
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy S9 8.0
