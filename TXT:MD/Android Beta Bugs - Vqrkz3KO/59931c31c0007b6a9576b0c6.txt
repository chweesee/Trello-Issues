### This report is no longer valid with the new channel creation UI

There's a new report detailing what happens when changing the display orientation now: https://trello.com/c/O8gYDNSi - Alexandru Todea on 2017-09-16T12:01:47.612Z

### I can still reproduce this by toggling the private channel toggle on/off. The roles that were toggled on are now off, but if you do the same thing without changing orientation the role toggles are still there. Moving back to Verified Bugs - Jared on 2017-10-02T20:18:36.565Z
