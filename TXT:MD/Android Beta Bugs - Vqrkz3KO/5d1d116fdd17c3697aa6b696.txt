####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to user settings then account and then edit account 
- Go to the tag box, and try to change your tag to 0000 
- Once you have put that in, press the save button (make sure you don't press on anything else before pressing the save button)

####Expected result:
The numbers and the hashtag shouldn't be merged together
####Actual result:
The numbers and the tag are merged together and it doesn't give you a warning that you can't change your tag to that while typing it
####Client settings:
9.1.1
####System settings:
Moto G5s, Android 8.1.0
