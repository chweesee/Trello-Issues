### artemisbot#6237 can reproduce on Android 7.0, Latest Alpha. - Jared on 2016-12-21T16:20:50.875Z


### Tested on version 3.7.1:

This no longer causes a network error, just a mention of "Missing Permissions".

Very possible that this was fixed as parts of the changelog on 18 March (v3.5.2):

`[F] Users can no longer modify channel settings without the appropriate permissions.`

Will only tag you @andygarron1 but not move it yet as I /could/ be wrong and reading the patch note wrong. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-04-24T19:33:16.581Z
