Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open any user profile 
- Tap on the "Note" text field 
- Tap the Enter key of your keyboard

####Expected result:
Not sure whether multiple lines are supported in notes, if not then it should just close the keyboard I guess
####Actual result:
The focus on the textfield is lost, but keyboard is still open for some reason
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.2.8
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0
