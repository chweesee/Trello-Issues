####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a new server, which would enable you to have "Add a server icon" model. 
- Click on it, and add a server icon of a screenshot from your phone. (Check the video, you will understand). 
- Then, it should lead you to "Edit Photo". Don't edit anything and press Save. 
- Now, you should be brought back to the server overview setting. Notice the server icon. 
- Save the changes. Notice the server icon again.

####Expected result:
Server icon prior to saving and after the saving should be the same.
####Actual result:
Server icon prior to saving is very stretched out both left and right.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.9.9
####System settings:
LG Fortune, Android 6.0.1
