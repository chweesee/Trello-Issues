Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to your account settings > Connections 
- Add > XBox Live 
- Enter the 5 first digits of the code 
- When you are at the last digit, try to enter many characters before all the fields get erased

####Expected result:
It should stop attempting to input letters as soon as the last one gets filled
####Actual result:
Each extra character will replace the content of the previous character at the last position, and for each of them a new pair of toasts "invalid pin" and "404 not found" will be generated
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.5.8
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
