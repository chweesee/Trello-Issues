Reported by ramune#7777

####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure servers (that you are checking) have the userlist to top (so you can notice the difference) 
- Scroll down on the userlist any amount you'd like  
- Go to another server where you have not touched the userlist 
- You will see the userlist has been scrolled down/affected here as well

####Expected result:
Userlists in other servers should not be affected when scrolling down in a different one
####Actual result:
Displays the userlist as scrolled down in other servers, when they haven't been interacted with
####Client settings:
Discord 19.5 (1116)
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy S9, Android 10
