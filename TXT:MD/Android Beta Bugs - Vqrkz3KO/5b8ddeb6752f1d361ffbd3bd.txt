### Can't see when you get a new notification (mentioned or DMed) while your keyboard is up. The red dots on the DM and Server buttons are hidden behind your keyboard With keyboard up -> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/434676109515292672/486348274899484672/Screenshot_20180904-033414.jpg

The notification indicator is also very small and out of your face so it's easy to miss it. - Sam on 2018-09-04T01:35:38.513Z

### Member list should be light in light theme to fit with the rest of the client now that members list takes up the full screen rather than a small part of it. It looks off with the top part being light while the rest is dark. - Sam on 2018-09-04T03:00:34.550Z
