P4, unlikely to ever be fixed.

Reported by AlexejheroYTB#1636

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a role with no name (not even a space) 
- Make changes to it 
- Open the audit log 
- Observe

####Expected result:
It should say: `**user#dscr** made changes to {snowflake}` (Since the role doesnt have a name, the bold stars shouldnt be included in the audit log message)
####Actual result:
It says: `**user#dscr** made changes to ****` (The stars are included in the message, and since there is nothing between them, they display normally as 4 stars)
####Client settings:
Android Alpha 8.5.5
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Android 5.0

### On Desktop and iOS, it shows the role snowflake instead. So I think that's the expected behavior. - Tarek on 2019-03-20T18:19:26.078Z
