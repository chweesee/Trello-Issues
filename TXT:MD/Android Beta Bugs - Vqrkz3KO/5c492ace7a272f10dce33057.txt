####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure Chrome is preinstallled as a system app 
- Start Discord or also join voice to easily see it getting disconnected. 
- Open Chrome, go into it's app info via recents menu or phone's settings app and "force stop" it. 
- Open Discord to find it had to reconnect to text channels and voice if connected. Or check terminal top with superuser to see Discord had crashed too..

####Expected result:
Discord shouldn't be affected at all by system Chrome getting killed
####Actual result:
Discord stops.
####Client settings:
Play store 8.1.9
####System settings:
ZTE Axon 7, LOS Oreo 8.1. Sony Z3 Compact LOS Nougat 7.12
