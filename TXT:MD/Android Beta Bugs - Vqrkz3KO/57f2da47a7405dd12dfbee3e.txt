Short Description: Most of the pictures are not going to gallery. I can only find one picture and thats it. The photos are being downloaded, but not in the appropriate files, they arent pic files, they are web files 

Steps to recreate this:
 1. Go to the site it makes you go onto for download a pic,
 2. download the pic,
 3. go to files, 
4. go to download history 

Expected Result: they aren't picture files 
Actual Result: they still aren't picture files
