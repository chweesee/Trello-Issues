####Steps to reproduce:
- Enter an emoji (nothing else) and tap enter 
- 1+ hours later, type some text and tap enter again

####Expected result:
The first line should have a timestamp and the second line should have a separate timestamp as they are said in separate hour slots
####Actual result:
The two lines will be treated as being in the same hour slot and no new timestamp will be shown for the second line
####Client settings:
Android alpha 6.1.9, also on an unknown version of android stable
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Android 5.0
