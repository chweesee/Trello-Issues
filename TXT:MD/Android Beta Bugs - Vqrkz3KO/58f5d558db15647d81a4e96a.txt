### I'm not sure why some people can repro and others can't, but for those who can it seems to be related to time? Using the emoji picker, all custom emoji picked within just under 1 second will have non-bolded text in the text box when they should be bold. If a custom emoji is picked after ~1 second, the text all turns bold as it should be. e.g. spam :customemoji: 5 times quickly, text is all normal. Add a 6th emoji after about 1 second and all the text turns bold as it should've been in the first place

### Can no longer reproduce. Emoji text does not bold immediately, but it does after about a second, whereas previously it would not bold until another emoji was added (see my previous comment & attachment). Seems to have been fixed.
