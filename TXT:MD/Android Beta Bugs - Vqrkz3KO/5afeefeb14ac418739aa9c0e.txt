####Steps to reproduce:
- Open an unloaded lazy guild where you have a private channel 
- The smaller amount of people who can access that channel the better 
- Open up that channel 
- Open up its member list 
- Scroll down the placeholders quickly

####Expected result:
The amount of gray placeholders is equivalent (or at least close) to how many people can access that channel
####Actual result:
The amount of gray placeholders is equivalent (or close) to the amount of members in the guild
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.7.4 (674)
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime ~ Android 7.0 Nougat
