####Steps to reproduce:
- Add a channel announcement webhook 
- Click on the server name (added X to this channel message) 
- Click the View server button 
- Click on the three dots next to the server name 
- Click on the Leave server button

####Expected result:
The preview should disappear
####Actual result:
A toast with "Unknown guild" content appears and nothing happens. After some time the preview duplicates as well, but I couldn't find regularity here.
