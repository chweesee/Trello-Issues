### To add to that:

If you rotate your screen WHILE that popup is open it completely cuts itself off as well and breaks. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-12-22T10:58:12.476Z


### Can reproduce.
Same device, OnePlus 5, Android 7.1.1. The app doesn't need to be in the foreground when the device rotated for it to be affected.

### Closing via overview [] button and relaunching Discord fixes this but rotation still causes bug
