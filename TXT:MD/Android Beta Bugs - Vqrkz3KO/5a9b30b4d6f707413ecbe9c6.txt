####Steps to Reproduce:
- Go to a server you will Switch  to and Scroll to force Discord loading enough messages 
- Go to a NSFW channel 
- Scroll 
- Go to the server, on the Channel you loaded (it works on a non nsfw Channel, idk if it works on a NSFW channel)

####Expected result:
: The position in the cat is supposed to be kept in the same place or brought down
####Actual result:
You arrive at a specific place of the channel that is not supposed to be (I can not define why this place and not another but it is not related to the height you scroll)
####Client settings:
At least from Discord 6.2.8
####System settings:
Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 - MIUI 9.3 v8.1.4
