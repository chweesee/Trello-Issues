####Steps to reproduce:
- Warning: this is an actual bug, it is not intended behaviour, confirmed by Dabbit. Do not deny this bug because of NAB. 
- Go to the channel with new messages 
- Scroll up to the point where New Messages separator appears. 
- Scroll down/up, hiding New Messages separator from the viewport (screen). 
- Turn the scrern orientation. 
- Observe.

####Expected result:
After a user stays in a channel for a couple of minutes the New Messages separator disappears and does not jump to the place it was, leaving at the spot where user was at the time or screen rotation.
####Actual result:
Chat jumps to the New Message Separator, which does not disappear after several minutes of activity.

### This is the current intended behavior.

The new messages behavior does not currently match desktop 100% but it is by design.

We will revisit it at some point in the future. - Miguel Gaeta on 2018-01-02T21:08:55.690Z
