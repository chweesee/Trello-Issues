### Might have something to do with indirect links? e.g. imgur.com/a/abc123 instead of i.imgur.com/abc123.gif. All direct links I've tried work just fine

### can still be reproduced with gifs that don't autoplay, those are downloaded as static files instead (sometimes with, sometimes without extention)
