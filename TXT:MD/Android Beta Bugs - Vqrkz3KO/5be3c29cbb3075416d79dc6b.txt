Reported by Tarek#1337

####Steps to reproduce:
- Share an image to get the share modal 
- Type something grammatically wrong or a typo. For an example "im" instead of "I'm" it should autocorrect to "I'm" but it doesn't but instead only suggests it in the suggestion box in gboard 
- Try the following steps above as well for search.

####Expected result:
Autocorrect should work
####Actual result:
It doesn't autocorrect your sentence besides from giving you suggestions in the suggestion box
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.8.6
####System settings:
OnePlus 5 Android 8.1
