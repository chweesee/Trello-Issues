### I am able to reproduce after following the steps provided by Xander#0259. When I reopen the app, it just goes to the first text channel, but my name is stuck in the voice channel member list.

- Join a voice chat
- Exit the app by pressing the home button
- Disconnect via the drop-down option in the notification shade
- Reopen the app
