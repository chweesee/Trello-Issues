### Can reproduce.
It hiccups a bit but no serious delay. When I tested it on wifi the delay was even less noticeable perhaps it has something to do with connection ? Samsung Galaxy S6, 7.0, 561

### Could be related to the camera library that we use: https://github.com/google/cameraview/issues/184

Apparently fixed in a more active fork: https://github.com/siralam/CameraViewPlus - Sam Shih on 2018-01-12T18:11:23.351Z


### so these are actually really hard to repro. For now I've added a few high level guards so at the least we don't hard crash. - Sam Shih on 2018-01-27T08:02:00.102Z
