 The cursor lives on in the next line 
####Actual result:
 The emote button halfway overlaps the cursor making it only halfway as thick (is that the word) as before. (May be OS related) 
####System settings:

### Noticed 3.4.1 (Beta) did the same behavior (without the emoji picker), it the bar got hidden halfway behind the send button. Guessing it's the same for earlier builds.

### This seems to happen on any text input. It doesn't look like a discord bug https://imgur.com/a/geJSt
