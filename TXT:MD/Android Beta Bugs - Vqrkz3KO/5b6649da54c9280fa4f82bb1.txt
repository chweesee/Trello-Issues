Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Enable welcome messages in a server 
- Have someone join 
- Assign him a role with a color 
- Look at the username in the welcome message and compare with Desktop

####Expected result:
It should be consistent with Desktop and iOS and display the username as white
####Actual result:
The username has the color of the role. This isn't a bad idea tbh but still inconsistent with other platforms
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.2.6
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
