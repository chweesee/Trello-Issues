### NOTE: The nsfw button isn't functional. It doesn't do anything. More: Tested, the button doesn't work in any way. Was known that it doesn't show if the channel is or became NSFW or not, but now I discovered that it doesn't work. I pressed it, and after it said the channel settings has been updated I looked to channel permissions using a browser on PC and realized that the button didn't do anything.
