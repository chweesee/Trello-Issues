Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Access Audit Logs  
- Open the Filter by user popup 
- Notice there's a manifying glass icon inside the search bar 
- Tap on it

####Expected result:
It should be a static image and shouldn't respond to the user press
####Actual result:
It acts like if it was a button but doesn't do anything. It doesn't look like a Submit button since the search applies at each letter typed
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.5.5
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
