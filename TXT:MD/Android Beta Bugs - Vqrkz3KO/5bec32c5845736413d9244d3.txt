Reported by denizariyan#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a VOICE channel with default settings 
- Update the 'everyone' role and DENY 'view channel' perm 
- Check audit logs on mobile. It might also be problematic on pc too I didn't test

####Expected result:
The audit logs should show that the permission 'view channel' was denied for the given voice channel
####Actual result:
The audit logs shows that 'read messages' permission was denied as it was a text channel although its not
####Client settings:
Android Alpha 7.9.0
####System settings:
Android 8.0.0
