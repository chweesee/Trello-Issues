### This doesn't only happen when your phone is charging. It happens even if your phone gets hot/laggy

### Can't reproduce.
Cannot reproduce, I've been charging, overclocking and running cpu+gpu intensive apps for around 20 minutes, can still open emoji picker just fine, according to some results I've increased my cpu temperature to more than 70 Celsius before the device starts to thermal throttle, it is also pretty hot by the touch ~ Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime ~ Android 7.0 SE 8.1 ~ Discord Alpha 699
