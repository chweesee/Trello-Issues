Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create an invite link 
- Go to Server Settings > Invites 
- Tap the link to open action menu 
- Press Revoke and then tap immediately on the link again before it vanishes from the list

####Expected result:
The link should not be interactable at all after it has been revoked
####Actual result:
You can open the action sheet once again after it has been revoked, and you are given the options to revoke it again (which fails with a toast), to copy it and to share it with your friends
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.9.1
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
