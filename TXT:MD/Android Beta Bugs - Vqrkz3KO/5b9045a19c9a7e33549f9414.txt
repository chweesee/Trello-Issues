####Steps to reproduce:
- Ensure discord is running latest alpha build on Android, and phone is up to date 
- Confirm all notification settings are enabled 
- Receive a mention (by name, role or everyone) 
- Not receive notification in notification area 
- Check your discord a few hours later to see someone was trying to reply to your messages 
- PLEASE NOTE This is not a five minute thing to find, Quite often I don't see I missed a message until a few hours later, Even though power saving is disabled for discord on my phone, I suspect it has something to do with background processing, as it's most obvious when I've been doing other things, not necessarily with the phone.

####Expected result:
A notification should appear in the notif tray for any mention / DM received with notifications enabled
####Actual result:
happens maybe 20% of the time
####Client settings:
Android alpha 746
####System settings:
Google Pixel, Android Pie (August 5th patch, build PPR1.180610.009)

### Can reproduce on Discord Alpha 7.4.8 on OnePlus 5 Android 8.1

I also see this issue with DMs. - Tarek on 2018-09-12T08:14:57.553Z


### we are having a hard time getting a consistent repro.
Just to be clear on the send conditions:
- discord app is backgrounded
- for GDMs and Server channels there's a 15 min silence if you don't view the channel (seeing/dismissing the notification doesn't count). You can also "mark as read" via the notification to reset this.
- mentions and role pings should always send if you have it enabled.
- DMs are always sent - Sam Shih on 2018-09-12T18:40:00.443Z
