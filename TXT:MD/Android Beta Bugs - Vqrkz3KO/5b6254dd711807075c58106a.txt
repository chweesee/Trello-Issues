####Steps to reproduce:
- Scroll down in your server list 
- Tap + button and Join a server  
- Enter invite code with invalid syntax (for example add a special character other than hyphen an underscore) 
- Tap Join

####Expected result:
I remember clearly that in older versions it used to show an error toast saying invite is invalid
####Actual result:
Join button does absolutely nothing
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.2.1
####System settings:
