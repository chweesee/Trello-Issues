### Can confirm this is no longer reproducable in 3.7.0 as well. @clayton301 the bug was that if you opened discord after fully closing it and immediately chose emojis that there would be no message indicator in the chatbox because it wasn't 'focused'. This behaviour was fixed. Still needs official employee verification. (Sorry for ping Icy don't hurt me) - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-04-21T10:20:12.086Z
