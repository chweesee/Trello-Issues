Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a JPG image that is around 30KB in size (or try with 50-70KB or a bit more if you can't repro) 
- Server settings > Emoji 
- Upload emoji 
- Select the file

####Expected result:
It should upload successfully
####Actual result:
It fails with a message saying it's above 256KB. I believe it's due to the fact that the image cropper tool re-encodes the image in PNG format, which is a format much less compressed than JPG. This was probably caused by the fix for the black background bug, but JPG images should stay JPG during the whole process nonetheless.
