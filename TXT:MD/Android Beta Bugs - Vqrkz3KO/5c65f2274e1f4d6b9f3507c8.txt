Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Switch to a language when the mention "N spots available" is translated on Desktop (e.g French) 
- View it on Android under Server Settings > Emoji

####Expected result:
It should display the number followed by "spots avilable" translated in the correct language
####Actual result:
It just displays "N" (the number of emotes) so there can be a confusion on whether it refers to spots available or number of emojis currently uploaded
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 8.4.5G
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
