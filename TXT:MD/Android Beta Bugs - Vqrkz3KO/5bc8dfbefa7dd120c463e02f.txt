Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Enable Sync across clients in Language settings 
- In a text channel, write something in the textbox, select some files to attach and keep the message in your drafts (i.e don't send the message) 
- Change your language using the Desktop client 
- Wait for the new language to apply on Android

####Expected result:
Your message draft should be left intact
####Actual result:
The text of the draft is still there, but all files that were attached to your message are gone
####Client settings:
