Reported by The Lunala#7777

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create an invite (or do anything that gives you multiple lines/numbers in the expanded view of that Audit message). 
- Open Audit log. 
- Expand the message that talks about you creating the invite. 
- Compare the position of the hyphen beside 01 and 02.

####Expected result:
Like on desktop, enough space is given beside each number so that the hyphens line up.
####Actual result:
The hyphens don't line up.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 755
####System settings:
Lenovo vibe K5+, 5.1.1
