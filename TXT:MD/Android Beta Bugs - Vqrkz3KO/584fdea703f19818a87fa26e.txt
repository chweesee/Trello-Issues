### Can still reproduce. You must be a regular user (no mod- or admin-type permissions given). The 2 options that are supposed to pop up are "Copy Text" and "Add Reaction" (3rd being "Reactions" if someone else has already reacted), however since there is no text to copy, and the repro steps have disabled reaction permissions, no options pop up as is to be expected. Giving the user permissions such as "Manage Messages" make options such as "Pin" and "Delete Message" appear as they should. Although technically not a bug, in this case it may be wise to either not show the popup, or alert the user as to why the list is empty.
