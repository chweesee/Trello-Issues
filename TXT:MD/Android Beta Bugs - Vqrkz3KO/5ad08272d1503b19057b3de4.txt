####Steps to reproduce:
- open YouTube 
- long press the recent apps button 
- press the homescreen 
- open Discord 
- use an invite (you don't have to join)

####Expected result:
the text should appear legible and normally but just for smaller screens
####Actual result:
the text is messed up and hardly legible. It's on the side and you can scroll up.

####System settings:

### In the Android system, when the app view takes 1/2 of available space (or less), it acts like if the app was in Landscape mode. Good to know
