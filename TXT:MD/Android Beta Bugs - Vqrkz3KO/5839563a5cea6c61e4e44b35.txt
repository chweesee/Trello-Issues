### No it's not, that's supposed to be working as had been before this bug appeared. I unarchived it and returned it to the Verified Bugs list. - Jared on 2017-10-03T16:51:30.352Z

### As per Jethro (who confirmed this), this is a missing feature which means this is not a bug. Because of this not being a bug, I am moving it to Not a Bug. - Ghoul on 2018-07-20T22:06:28.062Z
