####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a throwaway account (that's the easiest way to get an account you've never talked to before) 
- Close Discord on your "main" account to make sure you'll get the notification (completely close it from the app switcher) 
- Send a message from your throwaway account to your main 
- Open it from the notification

####Expected result:
Discord should open and show the correct conversation
####Actual result:
Discord opens and shows you the last chat you were in with a toast notification saying "You are unauthorized to perform this request."
####Client settings:
Android 7.6.9
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy S7, Android 8.0 with August security patches (R16NW.G930FXXU2ERH4)
