Reported by The Lunala#7777

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a channel with a fairly long name to show it to the end of the channel drawer without getting truncated. 
- Long press on the channel name for the highlight to appear around it.

####Expected result:
The channel name gets truncated a few characters before like it used to do before.
####Actual result:
The channel name gets truncated a few characters after than what it used to do initially. When you long press on the channel name, the last character moves out the highlight.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 753
####System settings:
Lenovo vibe K5+, 5.1.1
