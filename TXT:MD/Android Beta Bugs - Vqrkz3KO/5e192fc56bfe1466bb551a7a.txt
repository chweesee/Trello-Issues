Reported by TReaperTR#1573

####Steps to reproduce:
- I select "from: user" from the search options.


- I'm entering a user's ID


- It shows me "mentions: user" while "from: user" should show it "from: user"


When I search on the computer with user's ID, I can see the last messages of the user.
but when I search on the phone with the same option, it shows me who tagged that user

####Expected result:
- It shows me "mentions: user" while "from: user" should show it "from: user"
####Actual result:
When I search on the computer with user's ID, I can see the last messages of the user.
####Client settings:
APP INFORMATION - 10.1.15 (1015)
####System settings:
Huawei P20 P20, Android 9.1.0.371
