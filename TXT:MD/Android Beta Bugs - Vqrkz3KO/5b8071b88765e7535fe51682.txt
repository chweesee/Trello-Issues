####Steps to reproduce:
- Be in a server where you have basic permissions. Ask the owner to create a category with one voice channel in it that you have permission to see. 
- Then collapse that category so the voice channel is hidden. 
- Now ask the owner to take away your permission to see the voice channel. The category doesn't disappear (but does on Desktop). 
- You can even close and relaunch the app. The category is still visible. It only disappears once you try to uncollapse it.

####Expected result:
The category should disappear as it does on Desktop.
####Actual result:
The category doesn't disappear.
####Client settings:
Latest, 7.4.0
####System settings:
Android 6.0.1 Samsung Galaxy A3
