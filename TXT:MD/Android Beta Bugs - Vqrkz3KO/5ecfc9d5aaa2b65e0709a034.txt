### Can reproduce.
Nubia Red Magic 5G Android 10 ...  When I get a screenshare in a call or if I view someone's stream in a channel, When the phone is held vertically, I get the middle of the shared screen only, with left and right side cut off, and when held horizontally, its like the screen is zoomed in and I cant see any of the edges, makes it really difficult to spectate some games for instance
