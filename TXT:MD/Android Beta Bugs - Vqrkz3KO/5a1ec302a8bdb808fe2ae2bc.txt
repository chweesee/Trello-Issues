Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a new server and give it a name with a lot of words  
- Go to Server settings > Overview

####Expected result:
The text inside the default icon should be small enough so it can display 4-5 letters fine
####Actual result:
It appears enormous and can only display max 2 letters before cutting off with "..."
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 5.7.9
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0
