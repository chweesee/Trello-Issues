### I can no longer reproduce as of Android Alpha 7.0.3 on ZTE Blade Vantage running Android 7.1.1. My text in the codeblock line isn't cut off at all anymore, and the text now has some room.

Because I can no longer reproduce this ticket, I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-04T02:28:02.242Z
