[Archived] Sort option is available when long-pressing a server in the channel drawer, but is missing when tapping 3 dots button, even though it's the exact same menu (https://trello.com/c/bDn7e2sG)

P3 - Will be fixed eventually,

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open channel drawer 
- Switch to a server 
- Tap the 3 dots icon at top right of the drawer 
- Notice Sort option is missing 
- Now long press on the server in the list 
- Notice Sort option is here

####Expected result:
Sort option should be available no matter how you open the action sheet, because it's supposed to be the same sheet
####Actual result:
Sort option shows when long pressing but not when you tap the 3 dots button, which is inconsistent and disturbing for peopel who prefer opening server options via 3 dots rather than by long pressing
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.9.5
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
