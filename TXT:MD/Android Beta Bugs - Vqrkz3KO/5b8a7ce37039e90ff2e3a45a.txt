Reported by The Lunala#7777

####Steps to reproduce:
- Type in @ or colons or a hashtag to open an autocomplete menu. 
- Observe the top of the autocomplete menu.

####Expected result:
There was a line above the autocomplete menu before the 7.4.4 update which is no more on 744 and 745 which makes the autocomplete menu undistinguishable from the rest of the chat area.
####Actual result:
The colour of the menu now is exactly same as that of the chat behind it.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 745
####System settings:
Lenovo vibe K5+, 5.1.1

### Also happens when you attach an image with the add content button. There's no line now. I'm pretty sure there used to be a line.
