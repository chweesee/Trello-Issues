### If there are no roles besides everyone, this is intended - Jeff Cailteux on 2017-09-11T21:58:06.261Z


### I am personally unable to reproduce this anymore on my Samsung Galaxy S8 (SM-G950F), Android Nougat 7.0 running Discord Alpha 5.1.4 (514).

However, I did experience this issue on a server with 9-10 roles when I first launched Discord after the 5.1.4 update and restarting the app fixed it. - Alexandru Todea on 2017-09-12T12:12:12.743Z
