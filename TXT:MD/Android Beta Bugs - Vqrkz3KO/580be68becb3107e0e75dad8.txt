This bug is actually worse than its description and the description ought to be updated to “Mentioning users whose usernames starts with a role name mentions the role instead of the user”. It's actually impossible to mention a user whose discord username starts with the name of a role.
Look the result here with a "DJ" role and a few "DJ" users:

The @DJ♪Kiwii is correctly shown because his discord username is actually Kiwii-#9085 and thus does not start with DJ.
