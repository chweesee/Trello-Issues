Reported by Thundy#2018

####Steps to reproduce:
- (Might not work for invisible users) Give an offline user two roles, one without color and one with color.  Assign the one without color higher. 
- While the user is still offline, change the color of the higher one.

####Expected result:
The user's name color should change to the color of the higher role.
####Actual result:
The user still has the color of the lower role.
####Client settings:
Discord Stable 693
