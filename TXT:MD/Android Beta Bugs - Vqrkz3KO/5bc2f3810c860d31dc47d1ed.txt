Reported by Hole#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a real life friend (or a second device if you are lonely like me :D) ready with different accounts (I used my alt to test). 
- On both devices, head to "Add Friend" and click on the "Start Nearby Scanning". 
- Observe.

####Expected result:
It should catch your friend's account or your alt.
####Actual result:
Infinite searching. Nearby Scanning does not catch the user (However, you can send the friend request by manually typing the discord user, so I can confirm that it should catch).
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.6.7
####System settings:
LG Fortune, Android 6.0.1 (main), Samsung Galaxy Tab A, Android 7.1.1 (alt)
