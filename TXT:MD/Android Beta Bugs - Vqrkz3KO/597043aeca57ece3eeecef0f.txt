####Steps to reproduce:
- Open an app that shares a link with a title (ex. Youtube, Reddit Sync, etc) 
- Share via Discord 
- Notice the text box doesn't have the title of the post or video, just the link 
- Switch apps, then back to Discord to find the title is now pasted below the link

####Expected result:
When sharing a link with a title, the title should paste the first time, and before the link
####Actual result:
The title doesn't show up until you switch apps, then come back to Discord, and the title is below the link
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 3.9.9 (398)
####System settings:
OnePlus 3 on LineageOS 7.1.2 build 14.1-20170713
