Reported by Xander#0259

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have light theme enabled first (for immediate result) 
- install 713 
- open Discord and notice that the "friends" tab doesn't say friends or have any visible buttons 
- if you swap to light theme, close Discord and leave it for 5 minutes or so you'll get the same result. Switching channels seems to fix this bug

####Expected result:
Buttons and channels names are there off the get go (but they aren't)
####Actual result:
The channel name and any buttons that should be there are gone
####Client settings:
713
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy S6, 7.0,
