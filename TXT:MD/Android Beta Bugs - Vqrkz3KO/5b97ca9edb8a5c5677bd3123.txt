- Expand the overflow/dropdown menu 
- While menu is open, rotate screen

### The reproducibility of this bug is very inconsistent across devices. Even if you meet the requirements above (be on a Huawei/Honor/OnePlus device with Android 8+), you are still not 100% guaranteed that you can repro. Btw Enkiel's approval below is not valid because he can't repro the bug everywhere in the app, only in 1 or 2 screens.
