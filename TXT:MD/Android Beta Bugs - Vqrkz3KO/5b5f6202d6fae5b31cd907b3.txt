Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure you are in enough servers to have the server list scrollable 
- Go to a server all the way at the bottom 
- Ask someone to send an invite link to a server you never joined before 
- Tap the Join button of the invite embed 
- Open server list drawer

####Expected result:
The server you just joined should be visible immediately, as when you join the server through the full invite screen
####Actual result:
You need to scroll all the way up to see the new server
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.2.0
####System settings:
