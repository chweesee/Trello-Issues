[Archived] Filter options in the Quick Switcher do nothing if the search query starts with some special characters (verified with space, exclamation mark, and underscore. Haven't tested all) (https://trello.com/c/mM4ZY0bD)

P3 - Will be fixed eventually,

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Quick Switcher 
- In the searchbar, input any special character other than *, @ and # 
- Tap the three lines icon to the right of the search bar and pick any filter option

####Expected result:
The filter option menu should do its job, eventually by removing the space if it's not supported
####Actual result:
Filter option menu doesn't do anything
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.2.9 (Don't forget to update!)
####System settings:

### Don't mind the second part of the sentence in Expected Result, the !edit command just failed. At first I thought that it only hapmened with the space character, but it actually works with any except #, @ and *
