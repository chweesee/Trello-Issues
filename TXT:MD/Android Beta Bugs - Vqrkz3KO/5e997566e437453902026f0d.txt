####Steps to reproduce:
- have a 3rd party keyboard as current input method (preferably google gboard) 
- tap on the text area to open keyboard 
- hold on the space bar and choose a different input method (preferably default keyboard) 
- as soon as you do step 3, immediately swipe to open the channel drawer (keep your fingers on the screen as you open the drawer for about 3 seconds) 
- let go and observe what has happened, it should be resized

####Expected result:
after switching input method and opening channel drawer, the screen should not get stuck in a resized state
####Actual result:
the channel list, messages area, and member list all get resized and cut off (see video)
