### Was able to reproduce using the following steps provided by Alex1304#9704:

- On a server you have Manage channels perms
- Go to Channels, click the Sort icon and choose Text channel mode.
- Hold any channel and move it around. Keep holding it, do NOT release it yet.
- Press the Back button of your Android device **while you are still holding the channel**
Expected Result: You exit sorting mode normally
Actual Result: It will exit the sorting mode and go back to the Server Settings, but 1 second later app crashes.

The devices I reproduced on were a Pixel XL running Android 8.1.0 DP and a Nexus 4 running Android 5.1.1. - Chris Cox on 2017-10-29T00:47:57.106Z

### You can do this without the back button at all, just tap on Done instead of the back button.

Verified, but this is intentionally destructive behavior, low priority. - Jared on 2017-11-07T17:02:32.265Z
