- Mention somebody (works with (at)everyone too)  
- Click enter (but don't send the message, make a new line)

- Will not work in discord Testers (this server)

### Can reproduce.
OnePlus 3T, Android 8, Discord 7.4.9 - This bug seems to effect anything that is correctly parsed. I.E. Emojis, and I was able to reproduce this on Tester server, causing it to no longer be minor problem. Effective and Stupid way of doing this would be to Mention on one line, new lining and trying to mention where the text will go up/down on each character
