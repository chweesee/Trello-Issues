####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Discord on your Android Device. 
- Let a friend or bot keep editing a pinned message. [ I used giveaway bot by Jagrosh and pinned the giveaway. ] 
- If you look in the pins on your android device, the pin will get removed for a second. You will have to exit out the the pinned messages dialogue and press pinned messages again to see the pin.

####Expected result:
The pinned messages will stay and show that it was edited.
####Actual result:
It gets edited and then quickly says, "This channel doesn't have any pinned messages... yet.".
####Client settings:
Android Alpha 5.2.6
####System settings:
LG K7 , Android Version: 5.1.1
