Reported by StupidDroid#6253

####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a text channel with multiple long, hyphenated links sent. 
- I used <#274590523719811074> in this server. 
- Observe.

####Expected result:
The entire link should display on screen.
####Actual result:
Some of the text is cut off at the ends of the lines. This even sometimes includes clipping in the middle of a letter, as shown in the attachment. The link is still functional.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.7.3
####System settings:
Moto E4+, Android 7.1.1

### I originally thought this was a bug specific to my device, but it has been reproduced on multiple devices with smallish screens. It looks like the screen size sweet spot is around 4.5 to 5.5 inches.
