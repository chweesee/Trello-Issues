Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Use Light theme 
- Go to channel settings 
- Scroll down to see the slowmode slider

####Expected result:
As other sliders (like in Voice & Video settings for instance), the slider should have gray background and the circle should be white
####Actual result:
The slider background is in the correct color, but the circle is also gray, which not only makes it look odd but also makes it inconsistent with other sliders
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.6.8
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
