####Steps to reproduce:
- Be using Discord 6.3.3 (or lower?) 
- Use some emojis by using the emoji popout keyboard(ðŸ˜ƒ) in any channel you can to ensure you have some frequently used emojis there 
- Observe which emojis are listed as frequently used. 
- Update your Discord Android Client normally to version 6.3.4 via play store [YOU MUST BE OPTED INTO ANDROID ALPHA, SEE FAQ ON HOW TO DO SO] 
- Launch Discord 6.3.4 and open the emoji popout keyboard (ðŸ˜ƒ)

####Expected result:
The same emojis you selected and/or observed in Step 3 should be here
####Actual result:
A random selection of emojis appear here. Emojis that you likely did not use and all of them are from the default emoji set (none are server or nitro based)
####Client settings:
Discord 6.3.4
####System settings:
LG Stylo 3 Android 7.0
