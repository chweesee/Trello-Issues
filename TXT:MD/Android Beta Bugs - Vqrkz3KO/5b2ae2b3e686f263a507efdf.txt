Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Quick Switcher  
- Input a Space character 
- Keep adding spaces and observe channel suggestions list

####Expected result:
Either Space key isn't supposed to filter the suggestions list and then should keep everything as if the QS searchbar were effectively empty, or if spaces are supposed to be counted as a search query then the recent server list and last visited channel should hide, as whzn you search with actual characters
####Actual result:
The suggestion list gets filtered according to number of spaces in name, but it doesn't hide recent servers/last visited channel as it usually does when you search for something
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.9.6
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
