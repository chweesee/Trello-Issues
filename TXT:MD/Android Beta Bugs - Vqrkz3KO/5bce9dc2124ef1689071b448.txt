Reported by volcanicer#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Send a message with a code block (specifically 3 backticks) 
- Exit the code block and mention the user at the bottom of the message.

####Expected result:
The code block appears a line under the name, to prevent the mentioner's name from overlapping the code block.
####Actual result:
The code block gets overlapped by the name of the person who mentioned you.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.7.8
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, Android 8.0
