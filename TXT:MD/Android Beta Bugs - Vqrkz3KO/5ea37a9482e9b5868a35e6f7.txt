####Steps to reproduce:In chat: type "#" and click one of the recommended channel suggestions 
- Once you have that channel automatically typed out, attempt to add another channel to your message (NO ADDITIONAL SPACE AFTER) with "#" 
- You will see that the first channel you typed out will remove itself and you will be left with "##", even though Discord automatically added a space after the first channel's autocompletion

####Expected result:
Two channels should appear normally without removing the entire first channel
####Actual result:
Discord will remove the first autocompleted channel text (except "#") if typing out two channels, resulting in "##"
####Client settings:
v17.1 (1101)
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy S9, Android 10

### This shouldn't have been pushed through in my opinion. This is a Default Samsung Keyboard issue and it works with every single character, not only '#'.
