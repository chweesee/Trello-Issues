Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a channel with write permissions 
- Tap "+" icon 
- Select an image. Notice that when you select it it makes an animation where the thumbnail becomes smaller 
- Now double-tap on the selected image, so that it's un-selected and re-selected quickly

####Expected result:
It should be consistent and always show the thumbnail reducing animation
####Actual result:
The thumbnail fails to reduce and keeps its original size
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.6.8
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
