####Steps to reproduce:
- add a user or a role to channel permissions 
- grant or deny one permission 
- save 
- set that perm u granted or denied on default ("/")

####Expected result:
it should not say granted or denied because it got set to default
####Actual result:
if the permission was granted before, it sais "granted a permission", if it was denied before, it sais "denied a permission"
####Client settings:
Alpha 770
####System settings:
