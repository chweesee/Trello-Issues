[Archived] Rotating screen while holding a channel in sort mode will release it to where your finger is (https://trello.com/c/ybkqZg9o)

P3 - Will be fixed eventually

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Server settings > Channels 
- Sort > Text channel 
- Hold down on a channel 
- Move it, but don't release finger 
- Rotate screen (with finger still on screen)

####Expected result:
I see two acceptable options: either it cancels the action and puts the channel back to its initial position, or it doesn't release at all and should still allow you to move it
####Actual result:
The channel is released in the position your finger currently is, even though your finger is still on screen
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 8.5.5
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
