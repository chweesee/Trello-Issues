####Steps to reproduce:
- go to your Smart typing settings and turn Auto replace off (if you have it on) 
- turn Auto spellcheck on for the language you're going to test with 
- open Discord and insert a misspelled word in a channel or DM 
- notice how there is no red underline 
- type the same word in e.g search, QS, nickname change or server name etc.. 
- notice how there is a red underline indicating that the word is misspelled

####Expected result:
spellcheck should work in channels and DMs when typing messages just like it works in other places or how it works on "some" other keyboards
####Actual result:
spellcheck works everywhere else in the app but channels and DMs
####Client settings:
Alpha 8.1.3
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Android 8.0
