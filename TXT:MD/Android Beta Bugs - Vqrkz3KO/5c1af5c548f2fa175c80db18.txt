### You have no idea how annoying android notification system is...
Fixed. - Sam Shih on 2018-12-21T01:33:12.225Z


### Moved from User Reported Bugs to Claimed Fixed, needs Verification by Sam Shih on 2018-12-21T01:33:17.747Z


### Edit: fixed for DMs, but Group DMs have a higher barrier to fix that's not worth making now since it'll make the code really unperformant and ugly. We don't want to slow it down either since android OS now restricts the time we get to generate a notification. - Sam Shih on 2018-12-21T01:34:31.975Z
