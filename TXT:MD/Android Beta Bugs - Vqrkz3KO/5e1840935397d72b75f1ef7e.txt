Reported by Caus#0909

####Steps to reproduce:
- Install new alpha 
- Go on a server where you have only "manage channels" locally on a category and not globally on the server 
- Try to create a new channel in that category

####Expected result:
You can create a channel in every category where you can manage channels
####Actual result:
The "+" disappeared at the right of the category name and the "+" in the global channel menu doesn't work w/o global right
####Client settings:
Android Alpha 1019
####System settings:
Samsung S10+, 10.0 One UI 2.0
