[Archived] When tapping the "Joined" button of an invite embed to a server you are already in, it switches to the server but doesn't switch to the channel the invite points to (https://trello.com/c/XbCka6Ts)

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a server with two channels: `channel-a` and `channel-b` 
- Create an instant invite that points to `channel-a` 
- Switch to `channel-b` 
- Switch to a different server and post the invite link 
- Tap the "Joined" button

####Expected result:
You should be taken to the channel the invite points to, in this case `channel-a`
####Actual result:
You are taken to the server, but in the latest channel you visited, since you visited `channel-b` at step 3 then you will be taken to `channel-b`, regardless of the actual channel the invite points to. This also mean that if you post the link in the same server but in a different channel, the Joined button won't work at all
