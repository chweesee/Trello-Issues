Reported by sloth_.on._tabasco#9015

####Steps to reproduce:
- Don't have lightning fast internet, for you to view the bug you need to have somewhat slow internet otherwise the progress bar will be visible only for a fraction of a second 
- Go to a channel /DM and upload a somewhat large gif  or mp4 file   
- Observe the progress bar

####Expected result:
A progress bar with real time updates should be visible
####Actual result:
A progress bar with just a loading line appears and after some time uploads the file completely without going through the "real time updates" phase
####Client settings:
Alpha 8.2.5
####System settings:
ASUS Zenfone max pro m1 Android 8.1.0
