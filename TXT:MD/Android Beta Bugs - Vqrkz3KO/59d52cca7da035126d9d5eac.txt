Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure you have the "Store unsent text per channel" option **disabled** in your settings 
- Go to a server where you have `SEND_MESSAGES` permission on at least 2 channels 
- Pick one of those channels, write a message and send it 
- Long press the message and press `Edit` 
- While you're still in Edit mode, switch to another channel where you can send messages

####Expected result:
It should either exit the Edit mode and therefore clear the textbox (exactly like if you pressed the Cancel button when editing the message) , or it should take you off the ability to switch between channels
####Actual result:
Switching channels will exit Edit mode but without clearing the textbox, letting you the ability to send a copy of your message in the other channel you switched to
####Client settings:
Discord Android Alpha 5.2.7
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0

### There is also a way to reproduce this if you have the "Store unsent text per channel" option enabled. The Steps to Reproduce are the same, except there is one extra step: switch back to the channel you were editing the message from. Then you should see that you have exited Edit mode, so it will send a new message instead of editing the original one when you press Send.
