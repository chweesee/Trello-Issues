####Steps to reproduce:
- Set you theme to Dark 
- Observe Search bar 
- Set you theme to White 
- Observe Search bar

####Expected result:
Search bar correctly themed: input text decently visible and nice background color on both themes
####Actual result:
Dark theme: input text hard to see (can be confused with a placeholder text), on light theme the theming of the whole bar is just bad
####Client settings:
