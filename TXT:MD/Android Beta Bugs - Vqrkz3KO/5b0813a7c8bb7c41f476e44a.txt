####Steps to reproduce:
- Join a big server that has many people go online/offline in a short amount of time very often. 
- Scroll down extremely fast ( don't let the grey placeholders load) till you reach the start of online members list.

####Actual result:
You see as many numbers of bars as the number of people changed in the online/offline list.
