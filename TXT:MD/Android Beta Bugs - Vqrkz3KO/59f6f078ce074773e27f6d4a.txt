Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Connect to any voice channel 
- While you are connected, turn off the internet connection of your device (disable wifi or enter airplane mode)  
- Try to disconnect from voice channel as well using the Disconnect button (this step is important)  
- Enable your internet back

####Expected result:
It should've disconnected you completely from the voice channel and you should be able to reconnect to the same VC
####Actual result:
You can't reconnect to this voice channel as it still shows the "Mute/Deafen/Disconnect" controls instead of the Connect button. The only way to reconnect to this VC is to switch to another VC or restart the app
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 5.5.1
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0
