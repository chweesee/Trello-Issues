Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Be on a throttled connection. You can also turn off your connection completely after loading the app 
- Change presence status

####Expected result:
The sheet should close as soon as you select the new presence, and then the presence should update asynchronously
####Actual result:
The sheet stays open until the presence update signal has been successfully emitted through the gateway. This may result in the sheet closing with a considerable delay, or even not closing at all, depending on your connection, and depending on whether the presence update succeeds or fails (in which case the sheet wouldn't close)
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.6.7
####System settings:
