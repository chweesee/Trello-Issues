Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Scroll down in server list 
- Tap + button and Join a server 
- Input a full server URL with an uppercase character in the domain name, e.g https://diScord[.]gg/invitecode 
- Tap Join

####Expected result:
It shouldn't be case sensitive so the invite should count as valid and let you go to invite screen
####Actual result:
The link isn't recognized, the Join button is still locked as if you typed nonsense stuff
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.2.1
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
