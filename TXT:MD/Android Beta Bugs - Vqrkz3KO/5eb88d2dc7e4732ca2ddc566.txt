### Required to put a very long message in the channel topic, then tap once to open the rest. Some of the text gets cut off at the bottom with no way to scroll.

### Can reproduce.
Moto G7, Android 9, Discord 21.2 (1131). Roughly the last 64-128 characters may be lost, corresponding to 1-2 lines, depending on the input. Topic length needs to be near the character limit

### Can reproduce.
CSR, Moto G7, Android 9, Discord 22.0 (1135). Description is slightly inaccurate and should have been/should be edited, will add note to clarify issue

### Clarification, with the current UI the channel topic should not scroll when viewed, it expands when tapped. However when expanded, a long channel topic will get cut off at the end. Example https://imgur.com/a/u8IhhIe the first image shows the topic input field scrolled to the bottom, and it does not match the end of the viewable topic in the second image. Rechecked on 22.0 (1135)
