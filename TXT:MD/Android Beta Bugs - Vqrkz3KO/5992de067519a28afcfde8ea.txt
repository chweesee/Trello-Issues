####Steps to reproduce:
- Have permissions to change the Vanity URL of a partner server 
- Go Server Settings > Vanity URL 
- Enter a URL that contains a blacklisted word, try something that contains "discord" (probably the only blacklisted word at the time of writing) 
- Hit Enter and notice that you get a toast message saying: "A bad network request has occurred, please try again"

####Expected result:
You should get a red error message saying "Vanity URL could not be changed because ..." like on the desktop version. You actually get this message on Android when trying to pick a URL that's already in use or one that contains invalid characters, but not when it contains a blacklisted word.
####Actual result:
You get a toast message saying: "A bad network request has occurred, please try again"
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 4.0.6 (501)
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy S7 edge, Android Nougat 7.0
