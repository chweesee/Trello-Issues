Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a channel with between 60 and 100 new messages (you can have more but it will take more time to repro). It happens only if the banner shows a "50+" count
- Tap the banner saying "50+ new messages"  
- Scroll down until you notice the bug

####Expected result:
You should be able to read the message history smoothly
####Actual result:
When you're about to reach the most recent messages, the whole message history reloads and you're "teleported" to the most recent messages, forcing you to scroll back up to retrieve the latest message you were reading
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.8.7
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
