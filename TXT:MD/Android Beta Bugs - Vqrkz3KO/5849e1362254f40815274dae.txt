### I'm not convinced that this is a bug. Who said it should function like that? - Jared on 2016-12-12T21:13:52.062Z

### ```
mrkcsc [11:15 AM]  
android markdown is not to specification
but it‚Äôs also not a high priority because it works fairly closely, and markdown is used by a small % of users.
it would be fair to file this as a bug``` - Jared on 2016-12-16T19:18:29.581Z


### mrkcsc also states that `
mrkcsc [11:17 AM]  
I have been poking around with a complete markdown implementation on the side during off-hours but I likely won‚Äôt have it ready until next year when we finish launching all the bigger features` - Jared on 2016-12-16T19:18:54.753Z

### Tested in 3.7.3:

I can no longer reproduce this myself, but I'm pretty sure it was related to the the fixes to the markdown rewrite in 3.3.0 (27 January):

`[A] Improved message parsing/markdown support including: jumbo emojis and better code blocks, better URLs, etc.`

Moving to claimed fixed, tagging @andygarron1 per request since it's /probably/ a patchnotes miss. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-04-24T21:31:00.537Z
