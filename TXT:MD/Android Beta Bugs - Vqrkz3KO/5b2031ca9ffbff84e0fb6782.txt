####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to any server settings>roles 
- Create a role, add a space in the role name and click check any box that's visible (allow anyone to mention this role or display role members separately) 
- Notice the keyboard stays open but no text field is on focus. 
- Click space.

####Expected result:
Clicking on any button should close the keyboard.
####Actual result:
Keyboard doesn't close and if you press space key, it scrolls down the list nicely.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.8.9
####System settings:

### Can reproduce.
Can reproduce, the real issue is that the keyboard won't close, not that it scrolls down because the space key is intended to do that on physical keyboards iirc. Discord Alpha 6.8.9, Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0

### If I understand this right the keyboard should hide when I interact with the menu? OK, it doesn't. Minor issue. - Jared on 2018-06-14T23:44:43.026Z
