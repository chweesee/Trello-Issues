### Can reproduce.
Can still reproduce on Discord Alpha 6.3.8, Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0. Make sure you create an uncategorized channel so it won't inherit permissions from the category when created

### Workaround: If you want to add specific settings you'll have to go to "add a role". Then add specific override permissions.

Not super high pri given that. - Sam Shih on 2018-11-09T19:04:57.127Z
