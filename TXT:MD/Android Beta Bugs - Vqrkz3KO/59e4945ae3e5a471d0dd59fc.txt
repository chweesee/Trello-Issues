Reported by benji7425#6598

####Steps to reproduce:
- Setup a simple bot to view messages 
- Nickname an account 
- Mention the nicknamed account on desktop, observe the presence of an exclamation mark preceding the user ID in the mention 
- Mention the nicknamed account using the android app, observe the lack of such exclamation mark

####Expected result:
The mention using the android client should include an exclamation mark preceding the user ID in a stringified mention
####Actual result:
The user ID in a stringified mention from an android device only has numbers, no preceding exclamation mark
####Client settings:
- Android: 5.3.8, Desktop: Current release (sorry, can't find version number anywhere?)
####System settings:
Nexus 5X @Android 7.1.1, Windows 10 @version 1607 & OS Build 14393.1770
