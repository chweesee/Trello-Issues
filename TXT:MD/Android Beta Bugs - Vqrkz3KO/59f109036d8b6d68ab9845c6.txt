Latest Update: 2019-09-23T12:39:46.892Z

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to any DM (1v1 or group)  
- Type `@` and start to type your username

####Expected result:
You should be able to mention yourself as in servers
####Actual result:
Your username doesn't show up in suggestions, and typing your whole name + discriminator by hand won't parse it to a mention either. However, typing `<@UserID>` works fine.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 5.4.7
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0
