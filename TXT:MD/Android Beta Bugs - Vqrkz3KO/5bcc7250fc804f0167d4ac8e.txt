Reported by fujhofn.#0007

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a new channel or delete each messages in a channel (still work if the channel has a lot of messages, but it doesn't give the exact same result as in the video). 
- Post anything. 
- Copy the link of the message then send this link in another channel. 
- Delete the message. 
- Click on the link.

####Expected result:
The link shouldn't work, like a toast appear to say that the link doesn't work anymore or whatever.
####Actual result:
It depends, I had two cases when testing: the center of the screen was empty with the "You're wieving old messages" bar or the messages in the channel where we post the link appear.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha v7.7.8
####System settings:
Huawei P8Lite 2016, Emui v4.1 â€¢ Android 6.0.1
