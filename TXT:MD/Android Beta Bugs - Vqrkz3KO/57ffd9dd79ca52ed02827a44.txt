### I was unable to reproduce this issue, even with the following steps provided by Symplyfyed#4047. The devices I tested on were a Pixel XL running Android 5.1.1 and a Pixel XL running Android 8.1.0 DP:

- Join a text channel, and make someone to type a really long message in a long time (2k characters in 5 mins - maybe it's not required that amount, but after you can repro, they can stop)
- Watch the typing indicator all the time

Expected Result: The typing indicator shows literally all the time, just like on desktop
Actual Result: While the user is typing, there are moments when the indicator doesn't show. You must watch all the time
Note: It does not happen only when people type really long messages. It happens when they type around 1,2 full rows, but with my repro steps it should work and be more visible - Chris Cox on 2017-10-29T23:21:51.075Z
