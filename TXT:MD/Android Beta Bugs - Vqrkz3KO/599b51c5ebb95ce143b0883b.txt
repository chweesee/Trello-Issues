P3 - Will be fixed eventually

Latest Update: 2017-12-02T16:20:58.481Z

Reported by Hexexpeck#8781

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a channel in a server with around 45 characters in its name 
- Go to Channel Settings for that Channel 
- Back out of channel settings (make sure you made no changes before backing out) 
- It asks you to save changes or discard.

####Expected result:
It backs out of the channel without asking to save any changes (since you didn't change anything in the first place)
####Actual result:
It asks to save changes even though you changed nothing
####Client settings:
Android Alpha 4.0.8 (503)
####System settings:
LG X Power running Android Marshmallow 6.0.1
