Reported by JohnyTheCarrot#0368

####Steps to reproduce:
- Quickly double-tab the privacy/nickname menu before the menu shows up (it sounds harder than it is) 
- Close the one you opened last (the top one) 
- try to close the second menu (aka the first one that opened) with the buttons on the menu (pressing the back button on the menu will succeed to close it, only the UI buttons don't work) and notice how the buttons that are supposed to close the menu don't succeed in doing so.

####Expected result:
The menu is either prevented from opening twice or the buttons on the first menu opened (the bottom one) still work
####Actual result:
The buttons that closes the menu in the first menu opened don't work.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 5.4.1 (but also works on other versions iirc)
####System settings:
Android 7.1.1
