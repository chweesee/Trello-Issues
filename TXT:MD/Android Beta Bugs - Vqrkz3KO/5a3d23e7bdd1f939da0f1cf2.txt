####Steps to reproduce:
- Join a voice channel in a server you have Move permissions 
- In the voicd channel list tap on yourself. A menu should pop up with voice administration options 
- Move yourself to another voice channel

####Expected result:
The pop up should close and you will appear connected under the new channel you picked
####Actual result:
You are effectively moved, but the admin options diseappear from the menu  (anyway the menu is supposed to close), and you disappear from the voice user list until you re-open it

Discord Alpha 5.9.4
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0
