### The repro steps seem to be slightly different depending on the device, but the core bug is the same. On my Nexus 6P, I don't even have to do anything with split screen or DMs. Simply join voice channel, bring up the keyboard in any text channel, then close the keyboard and the voice UI disappears. However, bug does NOT happen in landscape. Bug also doesn't happen at all on my Nexus 4 running Android 5.1.1.
