####Steps to reproduce:
- Open the emoji picker and input some emojis 
- Close the keyboard completely  
- Send the message 
- You can repeat steps above but by inputting mentions instead of emojis (can be user, role or channel mentions)

####Expected result:
Emojis and mentions should parse correctly
####Actual result:
As soon as you close the keyboard, the emojis and the mentionw won't display in bold anymore in the text field, resulting in them not being rendered after sending message
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 5.7.9
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0
