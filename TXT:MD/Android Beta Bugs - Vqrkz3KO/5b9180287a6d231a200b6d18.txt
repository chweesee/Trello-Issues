Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have two devices with completely different pixel densities OR 
- Find a setting in your developer options to manually change DPI 
- Find a channel with a few text and emojis posted 
- Compare emoji size between the different DPI configurations

####Expected result:
Since the rest of the UI is pixel dependent, the emojis should be too
####Actual result:
The emojis keep the same physical size (pixel independency) while the rest of the app is scaled, causing the emojis to appear tiny on low DPI and enormous on high DPI devices (see screenshots)
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.4.7
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
