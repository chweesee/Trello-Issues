Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Restart Discord app the cache is clean. Having a slow connection may also help.  
- Switch to Dark theme 
- Go in a server with a lot of custom emojis 
- Long press on a message and Add Reaction (make sure you have perms to do so of course) 
- Scroll fast through the emoji list (way easier to notice)

####Expected result:
When emojis are loading in the emoji picker, they should appear as dark grey circles as in regular keyboard emoji picker
####Actual result:
Emojis appear as improper colored circles until they are loaded
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.1.2
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0
