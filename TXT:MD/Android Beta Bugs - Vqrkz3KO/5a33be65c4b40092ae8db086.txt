Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a channel with only 1 or 2 unread messages, so the New Messages bar is visible while you are at the bottom of the chat 
- Exit out of the channel

####Expected result:
The unread indicator should diseappear on the channel, since you were already at the bottom of the chat
####Actual result:
The unread indicator is still there. To make it diseappear you must scroll up in the chat and then scroll down to the bottom again, or simply use the Mark as Read feature.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 5.8.6
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0
