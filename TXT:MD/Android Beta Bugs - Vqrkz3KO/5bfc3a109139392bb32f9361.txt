Reported by Hole#0001

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to Group DM creating screen. 
- Search, and select someone. 
- Then, press on NEXT button to get rid of the typing indicator (This is why it's LG specific, because only LG keyboards have the "NEXT" button). 
- Spam your keyboard.

####Expected result:
Either it types in what you have spammed, or it does nothing.
####Actual result:
When you spam the keyboard, it highlights the back button. (Check the vid).
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 8.0.0
####System settings:
LG Fortune, Android 6.0.1
