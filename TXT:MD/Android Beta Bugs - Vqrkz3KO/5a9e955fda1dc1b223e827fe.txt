Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a server you have ban perms 
- Open Ban menu on any user

####Expected result:
The options should be black on white. By the way, the whole modal is white on Dark theme, i don't know if that's just a missing theme or a bug though
####Actual result:
Delete messages period options are light grey on white.
####Client settings:
Alpha 6.3.2
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0
