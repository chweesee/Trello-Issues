### Quick note: I can still reproduce this myself on Android Alpha 6.6.5 by doing the following:
1. Wait for a channel to have new messages
2. Close discord and re-open it
3. Go to a DM chat
4. Go back to the previous channel and name colors will be broken again plus it'll constantly pull me down to the bottom. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2018-05-09T02:54:56.446Z

### Checked on Android Alpha 6.6.6:

I can no longer reproduce this. Going to a DM no longer causes all these awkward issues. Apparently, as Andy said, the android app was trying to subscribe (lazy thing) to non-existent channels (AKA DM channels). - Alexander (DJScias) on 2018-05-09T13:30:53.858Z
