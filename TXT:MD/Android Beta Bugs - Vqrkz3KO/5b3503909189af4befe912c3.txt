Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to someone's profile  
- Find a mutual server you haven't switched to recently 
- Jump to it and then don't touch anything

####Expected result:
Member list loads normally
####Actual result:
Member list won't load and instead will show placeholders indefinitely. Repro isn't 100% accurate, so you may need to retry with different servers and different profiles
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.0.1
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
