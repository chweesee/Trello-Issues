Reported by The Lunala#7777

####Steps to reproduce:
- Try to call a bot. 
- Long press on the "Send Friend request" button and observe the highlight (if any). 
- Now, long press the "Okay" button and observe the highlight.

####Expected result:
Both the buttons are aligned.
####Actual result:
The buttons aren't aligned because their highlights aren't. Even if you look without the highlight, they don't look aligned.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 729
####System settings:
Lenovo vibe K5+, 5.1.1

### Dupe of https://trello.com/c/XwMBiSmM . Just found this when going through archived cards. Sorry for duping. Actually, not completely my mistake (probably) because title is not the best in the world
