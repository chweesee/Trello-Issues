Reported by Curse Broken#8659

####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a message that people reacted a lot to 
- Open up the list of reactions by press holding on the message and then selecting "Reactions", scroll down a bit and try opening a profile 
- Notice how the profile opens, but the app fails to load it and quickly returns to the reaction list.

####Expected result:
The selected user profile should fully load
####Actual result:
The user profile opens without an avatar or username, but with all the connections, then the app quickly returns to the reaction list
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 4.0.3 (402)
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy S7 edge (SM-G935F), Android Nougat 7.0
