### A better description for this would be "Can open member list by sliding over the send button."

Note that you cannot open it by sliding over any other part of the virtual keyboard. - Jared on 2017-01-24T23:02:50.161Z

### Can still reproduce as of 7/28. It's on the right-most edge of the screen. - Jared on 2017-07-28T20:53:34.793Z


### I am still able to reproduce this, sliding on the send button to the left opens the member list and closes the keyboard.
