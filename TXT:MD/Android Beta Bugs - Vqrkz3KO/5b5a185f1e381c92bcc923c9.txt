Reported by The Lunala#7777

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a server. 
- Do not change it's icon i.e. let it's icon be the default one. 
- Invite a friend with whom you share just one common server. 
- Open the friends tab. 
- Look at the mutual servers with the person in the friends tab.

####Expected result:
There should be 2 server icons side by side.
####Actual result:
The icons overlap. It looks like one icon is budding from the other.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 716
####System settings:
Lenovo vibe K5+, 5.1.1
