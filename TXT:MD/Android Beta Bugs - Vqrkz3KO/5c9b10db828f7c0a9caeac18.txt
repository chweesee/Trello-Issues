### Cannot reproduce. I see that the disrim error is the only one that shows up as we check for that to be valid first - Sam Shih on 2019-03-27T17:59:26.341Z

### actually... I see the confusion here. The error coming from the server, but the other errors in the screenshot are client side.

The fix is to add a client side check for empty discrim. - Sam Shih on 2019-03-27T18:00:53.795Z
