Reported by spin~#1337

####Steps to reproduce:
- tap on the emote button 
- tap on the quick search bar that appears 
- type anything 
- press enter (or whatever button that allows you to make a new text line) 
- observe, you can do step 4 as much as you want

####Expected result:
pressing enter should search for an emote according to what you've entered
####Actual result:
pressing enter creates a new text line, and does not search for any emotes
