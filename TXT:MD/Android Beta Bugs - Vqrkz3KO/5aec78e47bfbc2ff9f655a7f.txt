Reported by Ori#1908

####Steps to reproduce:
- Type a message. 
- Tap and hold, pin it. 
- Click "pinned messages" on top right of your screen. 
- Tap and hold on that pinned message.

####Expected result:
You should either be able to see "edit message" option or won't be able to see "add reaction" option. It's because if you add reaction to the message, it doesn't do anything in that screen, instead adds reaction in the server channel. So either remove "add reactions" or keep "add reactions" and "edit message" both.
####Actual result:
You can only see 4 of the 5 options when you tap hold on the pinned message in the pinned message screen (only "edit message" isn't visible)
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.6.1
####System settings:
Xiaomi Mi A1, Android 8.0.0
