Reported by Fayne Aldan#2423

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to any channel where you have embed permission (or just a DM) 
- Make sure that you have a computer so you can delete the image, or have someone else send and delete, so that you aren't caught in a crash loop. 
- Send this image in the channel and let the preview load: <https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/347974380862570499/352558217274064897/gmagik.gif>

####Expected result:
The preview loads and the app continues running normally
####Actual result:
The app consistently crashes and will repeatedly crash, as the text channel is loaded again when the app restarts
####Client settings:
Alpha 4.1.1
####System settings:
LG K20 PLUS, Android 7.0
