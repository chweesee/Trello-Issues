####Steps to reproduce:
- (possibly Android Oreo specific?) 
- Open Discord on an active chat 
- Hold the app switcher button, initiating split screen 
- Select another valid app for split screen, and focus it by interacting with it 
- Wait a few seconds for people to be active on the Discord that you had open 
- Re-focus Discord

####Expected result:
Discord should always be updating, even when not actively focused
####Actual result:
During split screen, if Discord is not in focus, it will not actively update
####Client settings:
Android Alpha 5.1.6
####System settings:
Google Pixel - Android 8.0.0
