Reported by Ori#1908

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to user settings by clicking the cog icon on the bottom 
- Click on any option such as "My Account", "Privacy & Safety", "Voice and Video" etc. and notice the heading of the page is "My Account" (for example) while the sub-heading is always "user settings" in smaller font 
- Now click on the appearance option and notice the heading and sub-heading

####Expected result:
The heading in "Appearance" page should be "Appearance" and sub-heading should be "user settings" just like it's in any other option
####Actual result:
The heading in "Appearance" page is "User settings" in larger font and sub-heading is "appearance" in smaller font which is incorrect
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.8.7
####System settings:
Xiaomi Mi A1, Android 8.0.0
