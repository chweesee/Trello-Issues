Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have someone send a Spotify Listen Along embed in chat 
- Observe on Android client 
- Method 1: change your language to one where the header is long enough to take two lines, e.g French 
- Method 2: In your phone settings, set a large font size (not necessarily the maximum), and / or set a lower screen pixel density in your Android developer options

####Expected result:
The "Join via Desktop app" footer text should have a constant padding with the song info area
####Actual result:
The text gets too close to the song info area, and it can even overlap it in some cases
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.6.3
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
