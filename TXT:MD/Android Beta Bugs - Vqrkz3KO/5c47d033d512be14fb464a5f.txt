Reported by Zwomann#5105

####Steps to reproduce:
- Connect a bluetooth headset to your Android phone. 
- Get into a Discord app chatroom with cool ass people. 
- Wait for your kids to call you on the phone and ask what you are feeding them. 
- Take the call, tell them they are freeloaders and have to do chores to eat. Hang up.

####Expected result:
It should go back on the bluetooth headset for speaker and mic to get back into the chat convo.
####Actual result:
The call is heard in the discord channel and your mates call child protective services on you for starving your kids. The discord chat has now transferred to the phone's speaker and mic and you hear nothing in the headset. If you get ANOTHER call, you can once again hear the discord chat in the background until you hang up again.
####Client settings:
8.3.2 (832), but this has happened over multiple updates
####System settings:
Google Pixel 3 XL, Android version 9,  Build PQ1A.190105.004, This also happens on my S8 and a friend's Google Pixel 2.

### @clayton301 â€” @jeffcailteux2 suggested to the reporter after we suggested him the ticket that you're assuming it could be a dupe, that it [SHOULD](https://discordapp.com/channels/197038439483310086/203907523709894657/537381889128923137) be submitted, but yeah the context of the results besides the 'you can hear calls while in a voice with someone' is a dupe of the ticket, should be maybe edited.
