Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Receive a push notification 
- Tap Reply 
- Try inputting a mention or a server emoji (twemojis work fine iirc)

####Expected result:
Autocompletion would definitely be a feature request, and maybe would be too much for a simple quick reply feature. But I believe that you should at least be able to put mentions and emojis by typing them out manually
####Actual result:
You can't send mentions/custom emojis at all
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.7.4
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
