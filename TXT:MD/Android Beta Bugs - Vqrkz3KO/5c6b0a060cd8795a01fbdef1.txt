Reported by The Lunala#7777

####Steps to reproduce:
- Search something that gives more than one page worth of search results. 
- Before you hit the search button, ask someone to delete the first/last occurrence of the search result. 
- Make sure that you hit the search button (after typing the search parameters) and the person deletes the message at the same time.

####Expected result:
Either the message doesn't show at all or does show.
####Actual result:
The search result count includes the delete message and when you reach the end of the page, you get an infinite loading circle.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 848
####System settings:
