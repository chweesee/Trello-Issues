Reported by Souji#4629

####Steps to reproduce:
- create a new server (do NOT use an already existing one) 
- create a new channel 
- make it NSFW 
- when prompted with the NSFW message press "Nope"

####Expected result:
you are taken to a safe channel
####Actual result:
nothing happens (probably because of the NSFW modal using the legacy logic of serverID = defaultchannelID)
####Client settings:
Discord 4.0.4. (404)
####System settings:
