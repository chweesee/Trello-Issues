Reported by Cliff#0666

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to audit logs 
- Click filter by user or filter by action (they both have the bug) 
- Click on radio button itself to select (not the label)

####Expected result:
It should work like clicking the label itself we shouldn't able to select multiple option when "all actions" or "all users" selected.
####Actual result:
When click on radio buttons of the specific option nothing happens, it stucks until you press the option label itself
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.6.2
####System settings:
