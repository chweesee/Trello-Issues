####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to audit logs. 
- Select "Filter by Actions", and select a filter that has enough results for you to scroll down. 
- Once you selected that, and the results appear, scroll down a bit. 
- Then, go back to your old filter (mine was just "all actions"). 
- Observe where it leads you when you go back.

####Expected result:
You should be led to the top of the list, since you never touched your old filter.
####Actual result:
You are led to some random scrolling spot.
####Client settings:
