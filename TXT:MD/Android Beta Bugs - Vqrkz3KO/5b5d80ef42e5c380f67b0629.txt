####Steps to reproduce:
- Interact with someone and send him a friend request from their profile. 
- Go to Friends -> Add Friend, and look at the suggestions (You need to have to new Add Friend Suggestions thing, currently available in only a few countries). 
- You'll see it gives you as suggestion the person who you've just sent it.

####Expected result:
It should only give you suggestions of users you haven't sent a friend request so you can send one.
####Actual result:
It shows users who you've already sent one.
