Reported by Ori#1908

####Steps to reproduce:
- Force close and open Discord app and toggle split-screen. 
- Keep it in half of your screen and click on quick switcher icon at the bottom after focusing on the Discord app screen. 
- Notice the keyboard pops up, leave it as it is and click on any last channel you visited that's shown there as soon as the quick switcher opens up. 
- Notice that new Discord app launches in the bottom half of the screen, the upper half reloads and quickly opens up in full screen. 
- Click on recent app to view list and notice there are two Discord windows which you can access simultaneously using split screen (although both respond exactly the same) 
- Force close and again start from step one if can't able to reproduce it in the first attempt.

####Expected result:
You shouldn't be able to open up two discord apps in a single session
####Actual result:
You can open and operate two duplicate Discord apps
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.9.5
####System settings:
Xioami Mi A1, Android 8.0.0

### Both windows switch channels with the other (e.g. I change to android-client-chat with one, the other also changes to that channel)
