Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a channel where you don't have permissions to edit channels 
- Tap the three dots button next to the member list button 
- Select Channel settings 
- Long press the Recent Apps button to trigger split screen

####Expected result:
You shouldn't be able to edit the fields
####Actual result:
You can notice that the Discord UI now looks like you can edit the channel's name and topic. If you tap on one of the textfields, the UI will revert back to normal but the keyboard is still open so you can actually edit. Pressing save will show a toast "Missing Permissions" and will show the unsaved changes confirmation modal if you try to exit channel settings
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.5.6
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
