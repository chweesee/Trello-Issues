### I'm probably missing something here, but I can't reproduce this.

There's a few things that are confusing here:
- overlay doesn't have a deafen button. (I turned on defean from the voice screen and it worked fine)
- opening the overlay shouldn't effect voice configuration at all. It just displays the current voice configuration. 

Reopen with more details or images please - Sam Shih on 2019-08-29T17:41:53.060Z

### The submitter and the can reproduce thought that the [Speaker Mode](https://i.imgur.com/tQcsWDT.png) here is the Deafen-button, as Ly already stated, there is no Deafen-feature. We discussed that just going to add this note for structure reasons
