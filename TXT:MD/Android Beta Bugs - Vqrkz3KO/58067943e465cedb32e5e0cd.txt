### Combined with https://trello.com/c/U3XfLSNq/70-app-redirect-invite-website-discordapp-com-invite-does-not-join-the-server-on-android Makes it almost impossible to join vanity servers.

Only way to join would be to type the vanity name in the "new server" (create server/join server) screen. - Cole Norman on 2016-10-18T19:38:42.793Z
