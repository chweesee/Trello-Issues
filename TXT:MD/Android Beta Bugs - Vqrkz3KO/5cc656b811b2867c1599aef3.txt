### can be reproduced only if you do not have any payment method set up. I had 2 entries in Transaction History and the page used to load but after I deleted my payment method, and went to settings>billing, it never loaded.

### I cannot repro, this could be a network issue. It's a low visibility screen so if a refresh on a solid connected network works than we will not address it immediate. That said maybe we should add a way to manually refresh.

for now just quit the screen and retry. - Sam Shih on 2019-05-02T17:47:25.128Z
