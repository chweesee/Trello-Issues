####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a role in a server with a name with the max possible chatacters/ a really long named role. 
- Go to server settings of a server you have admin perms in and navigate to members setting. 
- Right next to the text field where you can search members, there's a tab to sort/navigate members role. 
- Click on a role with short name, now click on the role with really long name and notice the difference in the width. 
- Just after clicking the long named role, click on any role above.

####Expected result:
The width of the tab should reset according to role name length.
####Actual result:
The width of the tab remains expanded even after clicking on short named role when u select it after clicking on long role. (Approx 14 roles above or below, the width remain the same as according to long named role and not to the selected role)
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.6.0
####System settings:
Xiaomi Mi A1, Android 8.0.0
