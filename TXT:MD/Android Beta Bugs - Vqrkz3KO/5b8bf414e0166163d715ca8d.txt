Reported by The Lunala#7777

####Steps to reproduce:
-  Get the in app notif that has the links to the server status page and Discord's Twitter handle (you headache on how you get the notif). 
- Click on any button above it (i.e. search, open member list button, open channel button).

####Expected result:
The buttons work because the notif neither covers them nor has anything to do with them.
####Actual result:
The buttons don't work.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 746
####System settings:
Lenovo vibe K5+, 5.1.1
