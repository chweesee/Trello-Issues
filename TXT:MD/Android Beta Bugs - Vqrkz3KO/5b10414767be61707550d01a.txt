Reported by Ori#1908

####Steps to reproduce:
- Turn on your devices' auto-rotation to on 
- Click on plus icon (+) to open add content panel and open the in-app camera 
- Set your flash to off or on from automatic by clicking on top left flash icon in the camera panel (it's set to automatic by default I guess) 
- Auto rotate your device and notice

####Expected result:
The flash settings should remain as it is (in this case remain off or on)
####Actual result:
The flash settings reset to automatic everytime you auto-rotate your screen
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.8.7
####System settings:
Xiaomi Mi A1, Android 8.0.0
