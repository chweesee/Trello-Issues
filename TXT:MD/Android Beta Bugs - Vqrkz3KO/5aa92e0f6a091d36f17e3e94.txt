####Steps to reproduce:
- This bug is only reproducible on devices without flash. If you don't have a device without flash, you can try to set up an android emulator using Bluestacks or similar programs. (I tested with bluestacks first) 
- Open up discord, and find a server where you can attach files. 
- Open up the "Add content" menu using the plus button next to the chat. 
- Try to attach a file using the paper icon. 
- Now the "Flash off" message comes up, despite you not clicked on the camera icon.

####Expected result:
The message shouldn't pop up when you try to attach a file.
####Actual result:
For some reason, the message pops up when you try to attach a file.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.3.4
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy Pocket NEO 4.1.2
