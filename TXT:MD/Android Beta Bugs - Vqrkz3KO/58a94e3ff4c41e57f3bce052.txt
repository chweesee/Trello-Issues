### I can still reproduce this as of 9/20 

Samsung Galaxy S8 (SM-G950F), Android Nougat 7.0, Discord Alpha 5.2.0 (520) - Alexandru Todea on 2017-09-20T05:40:15.201Z


### The voice UI along the bottom was roughly 2x as tall back when this report was made, so I can see how it could severely obstruct the chat with the emoji picker open. It's probably not as big of an issue since slimming down the UI (though it may be for smaller screens). However, the voice UI does hide when opening the regular keyboard, so it should probably do the same for the emoji picker for consistency's sake. - Chris Cox on 2017-09-29T19:26:24.953Z
