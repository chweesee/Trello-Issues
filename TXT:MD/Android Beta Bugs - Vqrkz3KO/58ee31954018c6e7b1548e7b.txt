####Steps to reproduce: 
- Make sure you're using push-to-talk 
- Join voice channel 
- Hold down the push-to-talk button 

####Expected result:
 Your beautiful voice comes through loud and clear 
####Actual result:
 It takes about a second for your voice to start transmitting, and the animations on the push-to-talk button seem slow as well 
####System settings:
 Nexus 6P, Android O Preview, Discord 3.5.9 / Nexus 4, Android 5.1.1, Discord 3.5.9
