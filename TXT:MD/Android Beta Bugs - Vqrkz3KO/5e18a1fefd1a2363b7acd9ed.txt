Reported by Usered23812#9558

####Steps to reproduce:
- Swipe the channel selection with your finger strong enough (works even if it's nowhere to scroll in your direction) 
- After it stops scrolling, tap with your finger on a channel or category until it pass 1,5 sec after swiping

####Expected result:
Channel/category gets selected and eventually opened, or if long pressed, its settings menu should open.
####Actual result:
Nothing happens, but scrolling *technically* stops.
####Client settings:
10.1.9
####System settings:
MIUI 11.0.5 (Android 9), Xiaomi Redmi 7A
