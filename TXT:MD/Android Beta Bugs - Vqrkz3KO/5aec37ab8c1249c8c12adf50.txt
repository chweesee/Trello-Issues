Reported by Xander#0259

####Steps to reproduce:
- share something, I used YouTube, images, gifs 
- once you're in the share screen you should see different channels or DMs/what have you 
- if you look next to the channel # you'll sometimes see a white Dot indicating there's a new message. 
- tap that channel and share there 
- 9/10 times you'll notice there are no new messages. And sometimes channels that don't have a white Dot will actually have unread messages. 
- I've noticed this happens a lot more frequently when Discord has been minimized and you're sharing from another app.

####Expected result:
the unread messages dot actually marks a channel that has unread messages
####Actual result:
it does not always mark a channel that has unreads and sometimes channels that don't have the dot actually have unread messages
####Client settings:

####System settings:
