####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a server where there is the nitro booster role and where you can change your nickname but not manage roles (DAPI is one of those) 
- Write some message 
- Long tap on your profile pic bubble 
- Tap on the "Manage user" 
- All the roles should be grayed out 
- Tap on the nitro booster role

####Expected result:
The toast saying the nitro booster role is managed with integrations shouldn't be shown as the user can't assign roles
####Actual result:
The toast saying the role is managed by integration is shown, even when the user can't assign roles at all
####Client settings:
