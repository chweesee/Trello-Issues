[Archived] Having single line codeblocks in messages containing linebreaks makes the height of the codeblocks very inconsistent (https://trello.com/c/53RRwcCh)

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- First, send a message with just one line of text including a piece of inline codeblock. Take note of the upper and lower paddings in the codeblock 
- Now write a second message with multiple lines, the first line being an inline codeblock, the second line being normal text, and the third line being another inline codeblock 
- Compare the height/paddings between all codeblocks

####Expected result:
All inline codeblocks should have same height/padding (unless there is an emoji near the codeblock, which is the subject of another report)
####Actual result:
Inline codeblocks height/padding will vary depending on whether the message is single line or multi line, whether it's in the first line or last line of the message, whether there is text near the codeblock or if the line is entirely made of codeblock... In a nutshell, very inconsistent.

### This ticket is an extension of https://trello.com/c/lhDXgSWe/1304-putting-text-in-to-a-triple-code-block-three-ticks-then-editing-into-a-one-code-blockone-tick-the-black-bar-surrounding-the-text while checked during the Trello cleanup event. I believe that it is an extension because of the same end result (you can compare the photos provided in both tickets, and they look the same to me for the end result), but have different reproduction steps.

Because of this ticket being an extension, I am archiving it. - Ghoul on 2018-07-06T21:06:55.728Z
