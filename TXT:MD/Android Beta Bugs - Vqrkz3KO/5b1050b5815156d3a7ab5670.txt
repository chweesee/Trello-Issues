### Moved from User Reported Bugs to Verified Bugs by Clayton on 2018-06-01T22:35:35.723Z


### This bug was checked during the Trello cleaning event, as an user had reported that they were able to reproduce on Windows. However, there was no reproduction on Windows 10 Pro x64 on Canary Build 18226 as it was impossible to have two backticks at the beginning then three in the end as the client refuses to send it.

Because of this, this ticket will remain. - Ghoul on 2018-07-06T03:48:55.002Z
