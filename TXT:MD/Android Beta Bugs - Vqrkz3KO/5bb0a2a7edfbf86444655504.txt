Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- In a server where you can create invites, tap the Create invite button 
- Rotate your device a few times 
- Wait a few seconds and observe

####Expected result:
No rate limit should be possible as you aren't requesting any new resource from the api
####Actual result:
The invite link disappears (shows blank besides "discord. gg") and the "You are being rate limited" toast appears
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.5.9
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
