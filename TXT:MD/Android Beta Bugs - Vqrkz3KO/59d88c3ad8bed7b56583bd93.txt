### Can reproduce.
CR Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0 Discord Alpha 5.2.8. Since it wasn't possible for me to disable the Download Manager in my Android version, I used Titanium Backup to freeze/disable the Download Manager directly from my system, as my device is rooted. It indeed crashed when I tried to download an attached file. Maybe an uncaught exception?
