####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to Settings, then My Account. 
- You should see "Current Password" on your 3rd box. Type anything in there. 
- Then, press on "Change Password". You should be led to the new password UI.

####Expected result:
Whatever you have typed in the Current Password box should be transferred over to the new password UI under "Current Password", just like how it transferred before the new UI. (Still works on Stable)
####Actual result:
Current password doesn't transfer over. You have to retype it in.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 8.3.6G
####System settings:
LG Fortune, Android 6.0.1
