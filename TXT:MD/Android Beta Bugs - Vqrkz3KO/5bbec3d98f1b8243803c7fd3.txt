####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to audit log, then filter it to action that has logs. 
- Observe. If this doesn't happen the first time, restart discord, and go to another server's audit log (it helped me reproduce it when I went to other server's log).

####Expected result:
Logs show.
####Actual result:
Logs are completely gone, until you restart Discord (it fixes by itself sometimes).
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.6.7
####System settings:
LG Fortune, Android 6.0.1
