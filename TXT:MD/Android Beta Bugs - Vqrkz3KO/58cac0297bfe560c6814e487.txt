### Tested on 3.7.8:

I can no longer reproduce this, it just displays the date normally.

Pretty sure this was fixed in 3.5.2 (18 march) as per: `[F] Buggy Nitro tooltip text.`

Moving to claimed fixed and pinging @andygarron1 as requested with patch note misses. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-04-26T22:49:14.303Z
