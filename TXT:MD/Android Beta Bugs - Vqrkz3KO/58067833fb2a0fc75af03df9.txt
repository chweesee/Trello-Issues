### Combined with https://trello.com/c/Sfw9kity/71-vanity-urls-are-not-opening-the-join-server-dialog-in-app-instead-redirecting-to-the-discordapp-com-invite-website Makes it almost impossible to join vanity servers.

Only way to join would be to type the vanity name in the "new server" (create server/join server) screen. - Cole Norman on 2016-10-18T19:38:10.367Z
