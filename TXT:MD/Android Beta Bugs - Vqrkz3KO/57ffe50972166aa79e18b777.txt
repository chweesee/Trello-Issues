I just repoed it. It seems like there is a 10 second delay from changing to DND and over a minute or two for going invisable (Got 1 1/2 from Canary and 2 1/2 from Android Alpha). All other status change right away (Online / Idle)(edited)
This was all tested in iOS, Android and Canary which showed the same bug - Cole Norman on 2016-10-13T19:48:48.642Z


### Issues that happens on all platforms should go to canary as they are backend issue. - Jared on 2016-10-24T20:12:38.783Z


### Cannot reproduce.  The status is updating in real time for me. - Jared on 2016-10-24T20:13:11.055Z
