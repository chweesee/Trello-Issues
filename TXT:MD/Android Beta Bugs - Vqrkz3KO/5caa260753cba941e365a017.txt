**These issues are specific to 8.7.1**

There is currently several reports of the Discord client throwing ``An unknown network error has occurred`` when doing one of the below actions. I will update the ticket when more issues comes in.

If you found an another action causing this toast message, leave a note or a !canrepro, thanks.

### Can reproduce.
Happens also upon text channel deletion. When clicking Confirm on the Delete Text Channel modal, the modal won't close and the same error gets thrown in debug logs. Though I don't get the Unknown Network error toast in this instance.
