Reported by Symplyfyed#4913

####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a new account 
- Do not verify the email 
- Join a sever that requires you to verify the email  
- Go to server, and where you should press to chat, press "verify" or whatever the button for verification is called 
- Press "change email" in the window that pops up 
- Enter a new email, and the correct password 
- Observe that even if the password is correct, you cannot press the verify account button.  
- Additional information: the password is not censored. This may be a bug too.

####Expected result:
You should be able to verify the account when you try to change the email
####Actual result:
You cannot press the verify account button, even if all the info is typed correctly. (More: the password is not censored)
