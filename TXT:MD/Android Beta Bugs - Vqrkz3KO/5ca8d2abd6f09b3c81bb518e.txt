####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure you don't have 2FA enabled.  
- Go to User Settings and tap on "Enable 2FA"  
- At the 1st step, change the screen orientation to landscape.  
- Observe the text [Download and... tablet] getting cut. More prominent results at 150% font scale.  
- Tap next and observe the 2nd step. (this might require 150% font scale)  
- The text "Launch Authy/Google Autgencator" gets cut.  
- Tap next and observe the 3rd step. (this required 150% font scale)  
- Observe all the text under the "Enable SMS Authentication"  
- If you began this reproduction from landscape mode at the beginning, you won't even see the "Enable SMS Authentication" button.

####Expected result:
In both the steps, the text should accommodate within the screen.
####Actual result:
The text gets cut off in landscape mode.
