####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a server 
- Open the member list 
- Turn off your data/WiFi 
- Tap any user and scroll to the note field. Note that it resolves after several seconds

####Expected result:
It should say only "Loading Note" and not "Tap to add a note" while loading, and then after loading remove "Loading note" and replace it with "Tap to add a note"
####Actual result:
Both strings are displayed simultaneously over-top of each other while loading, and then after loading the "Loading note" string is removed leaving the "Tap to add a note" string
####Client settings:
Discord 22.2 (1141)
####System settings:
