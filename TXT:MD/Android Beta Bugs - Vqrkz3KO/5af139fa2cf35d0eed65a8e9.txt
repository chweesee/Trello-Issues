### Tested on Android Alpha 6.6.4:

I can no longer reproduce this myself, member list loads fine now.

Edit: Spoken to Dabbit and will be moving this to Claimed Fixed due to it being referenced in 6.6.4's changelog:
`- Addresses an issue where if you flung the member list down, locked the phone before the members loaded, and then unlocked the phone, the members could never load` - Alexander (DJScias) on 2018-05-09T01:28:29.178Z


### Moved from Lazy Guild Issues to Claimed Fixed, needs Verification by Alexander (DJScias) on 2018-05-09T02:11:17.787Z


### Closing out this ticket as it's been in a resolved state for 30 or more days with no additional reproductions or new steps. - Jared on 2018-07-06T21:17:54.355Z
