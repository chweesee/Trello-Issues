[Archived] In Quick Switcher, when your query gives no results, going back from Add a Friend screen won't have the same behavior as going back from Join a Server screen (https://trello.com/c/mYDXNZoZ)

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Quick Switcher 
- Type nonsense stuff in the input box to have no results 
- Tap the Add Friend button 
- Go back. Notice you still have the text in the input box  
- Now tap the Join Server button 
- Go back. Notice how the contents of the QS got reset

####Expected result:
Going back from either Add Friend or Join Server should have a similar behavior
####Actual result:
Their behavior are inconsistent between each other: one clears the query upon going back while the other keeps it
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.3.0
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0

### Can reproduce.
Still reproducible as of 8.7.1, but now it's even worse: the QS completely closes upon going back from Join a Server.
