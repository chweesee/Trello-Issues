####Steps to reproduce:
- switch to the DM you will be receiving a message from 
- close discord 
- receive the DM while discord is closed 
- open the DM you received while discord was closed (also works if you quickly switch to that DM after opening discord)

####Expected result:
You will open up the DM, and it will only say the user is typing if they actually are
####Actual result:
It will say the user is typing for about two (2) seconds even though they are not
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.4.3
