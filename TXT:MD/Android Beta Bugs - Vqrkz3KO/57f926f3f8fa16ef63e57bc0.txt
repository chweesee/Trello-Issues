### I was unable to reproduce this issue, even with the new steps & information below provided by Xander#0259. The devices I tested on were a Pixel XL running Android 8.1.0 DP and a Nexus 4 running Android 5.1.1.

- open Discord and then hit your devices' home button
- leave Discord running in the background for a while, like 30 minutes or so
- have a friend DM you after the 30 minutes 
- notice that most times you won't receive a ping for a new DM

I believe this issue to be linked to the issue where servers have new messages but a server will not update until you tap on a new server. It's as though the client becomes stale and doesn't consistently refresh the session - Chris Cox on 2017-10-30T00:23:38.454Z
