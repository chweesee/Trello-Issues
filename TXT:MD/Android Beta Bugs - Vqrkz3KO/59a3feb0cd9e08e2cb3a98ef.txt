### Can reproduce.
Seems to only happen if you re-open the app from your home screen or the app drawer, multitasking it works just fine. Google Pixel XL, Android 8.0.0, Discord 5.2.7 (527)

### Tested on Android Alpha 6.3.7:

I can still reproduce this myself. It's as Chrees mentions in a comment before: If I switch to it without re-opening it from the home screen or app drawer then it'll persist. Otherwise it'll just bring me back to the login/register page.

Not sure if the above is intended behaviour? (Only persists if switching to) Will beep Dabbit as well. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2018-03-14T19:58:34.859Z
