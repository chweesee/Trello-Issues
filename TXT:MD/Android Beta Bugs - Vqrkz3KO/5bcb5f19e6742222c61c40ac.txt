####Steps to reproduce:
- [Possibly for non-P3XL Devices] In Android Developer settings, enable Tall Notch mode. 
- Open discord on a tall-notch device 
- Open server/channel drawer

####Expected result:
Discord draws things below the notch instead of cramming the top
####Actual result:
Discord draws in the large notification bar, and hides part of the search box under the notch, as well as draws the Friends button above the notch
####Client settings:
Discord Canary 774
####System settings:
Pixel 3 XL, Android 9
