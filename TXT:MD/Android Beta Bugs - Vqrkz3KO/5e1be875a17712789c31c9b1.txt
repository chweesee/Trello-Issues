####Steps to reproduce:
- Get a ping while discord is closed so that you get a notification for that ping 
- Open Discord 
- Open a server where you don't have a ping and open an unread channel 
- Scroll down so that the channel is marked read 
- Open the channel where you got pinged

####Expected result:
Ping notification should be cleared automatically
####Actual result:
Notification is remaining as it is. I had to clear it manually
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 1020
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy J2, Android 6.0.1
