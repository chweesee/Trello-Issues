### I cannot reproduce this issue - additionally I do suspect itâ€™s possible but limited to a small number of lower API devices.

I also suspect this is purely a visual distortion and should not prevent the user from successfully saving and/or cropping their image. - Miguel Gaeta on 2016-10-08T19:05:07.571Z


### Referencing from https://trello.com/c/HQMvgI4P/62-better-image-cropping which is a feature Ticket that supercedes this bug as it will insert a new cropping library. - Miguel Gaeta on 2016-10-08T19:11:03.432Z
