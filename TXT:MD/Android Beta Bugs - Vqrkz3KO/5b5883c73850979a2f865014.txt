[Archived] When overlapping the mutual server action-bar over the "send friend request" button, you will still be able to send a friend request through the overlapped action bar [You may need much time to do it correctly, please note that the overlapped action bar has to be just a bit over the "friend request" button] (https://trello.com/c/UYOs1Ib1)

P3 - Will be fixed eventually,

####Steps to reproduce:-Go to the 3 line symbol (â‰¡) on your android device
-Go to a user that you want to friend
-Scroll the action bar ( [User-Details    Mutual Servers   Mutual Friends] ) just a bit over the green "send friend request" button (not too much!)
-Try to click the "send friend request" button on the border of the action bar. Maybe use a pen tool, if you can't do that with your fingers
-Scroll the Menu (User-Details, Mutual Servers, Mutual Friends) down to proof, if the friend request has been sent

####Expected result:
You should not be able to send a friend request, becasue the action bar is overlapping the "send friend request" button, so that you cannot execute two actions at the same time
####Actual result:
You are able to send a friend request, even if the action bar is overlapped (see attached video)
####Client settings:
Discord, 7.1.2
####System settings:
Samsung S5, 6.0.1
