####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a new server 
- Go to Server Settings > Overview > 3dots menu > Delete server. Do NOT confirm the modal yet.  
- Minimize the app using the Home button of your Android device 
- Re-open the app using the Recent Tasks screen. Do NOT re-open it using the icon shortcut on your homescreen or else you will reproduce bug <>

It should just re-open Discord displaying the confirm modal without doing anything else.
