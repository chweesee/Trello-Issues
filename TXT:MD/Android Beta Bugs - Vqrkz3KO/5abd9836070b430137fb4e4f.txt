####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a very long debug log. For that, use the app intensively or let it open for a long time. If the scrollbar looks tiny, then you're probably good to go 
- Go to Debug log and tap Share button at top right. Note that sometimes you need to do it several times to reproduce it (close Share menu and tap button again)

####Expected result:
Sharing debug log should work regardless of the length
####Actual result:
Discord crashes upon pressing Share button. Usually it doesn't crash instantly, first the button will simply not work, and when pressed repeatedly the crash happens
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.4.5
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0
