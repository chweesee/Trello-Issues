### I cannot reproduce following the steps Symplyfyed#4913 provided, the DM/mention goes away on Android as soon as I view it on desktop.

- Get a DM
- see it on another client
- observe that the DM ping doesn't go away on Android

Samsung Galaxy S8 (SM-G950F), Android Nougat 7.0, Discord 5.2.6 and Windows 10 Home 64-bit v1703, Discord Canary, Build 5141
