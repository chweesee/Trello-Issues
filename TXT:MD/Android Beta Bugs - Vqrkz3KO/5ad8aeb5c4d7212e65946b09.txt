### I checked on this ticket during the Trello Cleaning Event, however, I am still able to reproduce this bug as of Android Alpha 7.0.3 on ZTE Blade Vantage running Android 7.1.1. The toast still tells me that my account's settings have been successfully saved but nothing has really changed since the information given is incorrect.

I will leave this ticket to be. - Ghoul on 2018-07-04T02:31:25.219Z
