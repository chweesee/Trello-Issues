####Steps to reproduce:
- Create a new server with the channel configuration given in the attached screenshot 
- On Android, go to Create Instant Invite and expand the dropdown menu where you can select a channel. Make sure that the channels are ordered as the following in the dropdown: `a, b, c, d, e, f` 
- On Desktop, move the category 2 above the category 1 
- Repeat step 2 on Android, the order should be now: `d, e, f, a, b, c` 
- On Desktop, revert the category order as it was before step 3 
- On Android, go to Server Settings > Channels, enter Category sort mode and move Category 2 above Category 1 again 
- Return to Create Instant Invite and now observe the order

####Expected result:
Android client should re-assign channel position indexes properly when sorting categories. If the bug didn't occur, I should have seen `d, e, f, a, b, c` after following steps above
####Actual result:
Android does not re-assign position indexes of channels when moving categories, resulting in having the channel ordering in an inconsistent state. After following the steps above I'm seeing `a, b, c, d, e, f` in dropdown menus while the actual order in server list is `d, e, f, a, b, c`
