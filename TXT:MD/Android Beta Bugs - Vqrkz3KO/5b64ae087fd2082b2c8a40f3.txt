[Archived] If you're attempting to send an image flagged as explicit in a channel with explicit content filter enabled, the upload bar vanishes and you won't get any error message (https://trello.com/c/2w9Fu1MX)

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Find an image that can potentially be flagged as explicit content 
- Post it in a non-NSFW channel where you have Attach Files permissions, and where the server has Explicit filter enabled for all members in Server Settings > Moderation

####Expected result:
You should get an error saying that the explicit content filter rejected it. On Desktop it is handled by Clyde sending you a client-side message
####Actual result:
The upload bar just disappears and absolutely nothing happens
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.2.3
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0

### Can reproduce.
This bug also effects channels that have upload permissions disabled. This would be a helpful fix as upload always shows. https://trello.com/c/8dOKHpuL
