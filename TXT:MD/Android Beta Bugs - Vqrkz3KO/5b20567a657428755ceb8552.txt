####Steps to reproduce:
- Send message while losing/changing internet connection 
- Attempt to resend the message or try to send a new message.

####Expected result:
Pressing resend or sending a new message would reconnect to the server and deliver the message.

All messages fail to deliver until discord is fully closed and reopened, at which point messages are delivered immediate again.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.8.7 (687)
####System settings:
Xiaomi Mi A1, Android 8.0  5th of March update.

### Can reproduce.
Samsung Galaxy S6, 7.0, 687, I've had this happen most frequently when my phone switches from wifi to 4G. An error toast about connection to server being lost usually follows and the message will not resend and restarting Discord does fix this

### Reviewing the video makes it unclear if the steps to reproduce are actually correct. Issue happened while on the walking using 4G but I did not notice if internet connection actually dropped when it happened.

### Plz ignore the below comment. Just a test because our bot wasn't feeling well. - Ghoul on 2018-08-08T21:05:02.873Z


### Can reproduce.
I have been able to consistently reproduce this for months on my G6 on android 7.X and 8.0.  It seems to be if you send a message exactly when you transition between Wi-Fi and cellular connection, it fails to send and blocks you from sending. I discussed with Jethro and it seems to be the block of being disconnected not removing and allowing you to reconnect. I attached the debug logs for the most recent occurrence
