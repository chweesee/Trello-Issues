### Can reproduce.
CR • Samsung Galaxy J7 • Android 8.1 (Oreo) • Discord Alpha 7.8.6 (786) •  this also happens in any place you can scroll up or down, excluding text channels (e.g. server and member list, Connections, voice and video,  in user Settings screen, language > change language, Change Log,  debug, recent mentions, and quickswitcher (QS) from what I could see.
