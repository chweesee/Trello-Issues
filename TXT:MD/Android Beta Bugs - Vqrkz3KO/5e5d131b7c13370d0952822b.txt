Reported by Ori#1908

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have an incoming friend request. 
- Open the same user's profile and click on ignore then quickly click on accept as well before the profile popup closes.

####Expected result:
You should be only able to reject the invite.
####Actual result:
Request rejected message appears on bottom, then suddenly request accepted message comes as well while the request actually gets denied and friend request is sent to the person instead.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 11.4 (1045)
####System settings:
Xiaomi Mi A1 running Android Pie (9)
