### Tested on Alpha v3.8.3:

I can no longer reproduce this myself.

From what I can tell, it (most likely) got fixed alongside of the custom ones per this note (v3.8.3, 9 May 2017):
`- Custom emojis can render in embeds. But will they? Unravel the mystery.`

As per the "fixed in patchnotes, but not moved" protocol, mentioning @andygarron1 (to check if I'm wrong or not) and moving it to "Claimed Fixed". - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-05-10T02:17:05.373Z
