[Archived] In French language, when there are no members to prune, the message on the modal will say "Pruning will kick 1 member [...]" instead of 0. (https://trello.com/c/Rp0FbIrN)

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Switch language to French 
- Create a new server (simpler than looking for one where there are no members to prune) 
- Go to Server Settings > Members > 3dots > Prune 
- Observe the small message on the modal

####Expected result:
Should say "Purger expulsera 0 membre" (literally "Pruning will kick 0 members")
####Actual result:
it says "Purger expulsera 1 membre". **The string is correctly translated through i18n and this doesn't happen on Desktop!**
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.1.9
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0

### due to how we share strings across platforms and how they differ, this is extremely difficult to fix. What you see is a patched localization system between the client.

The solution is to have proper i18n logic for pluralization. Such as http://icu-project.org/apiref/icu4j/com/ibm/icu/text/PluralRules.html. However pulling in less resources and integrated with android. - Sam Shih on 2018-03-27T23:42:27.505Z
