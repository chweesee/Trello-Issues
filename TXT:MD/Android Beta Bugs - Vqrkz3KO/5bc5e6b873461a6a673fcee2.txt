[Archived] Discord crashes if you try to upload a huge file that greatly exceeds the 50mb upload limit (Try files of around 500mb). Alternatively the upload gets stuck on Queuing for a while and then crashes. (https://trello.com/c/OC5Co1oS)

P3 - Will be fixed eventually,

Reported by OddsomeOddy#1998

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a huge file on your phone (in my case a zip file of ~500mb) 
- Select the file and try to upload it

####Expected result:
Discord should cancel the upload and tell you that only files below 50mb are allowed
####Actual result:
Discord crashes after about 3 seconds
####Client settings:
Alpha 7.7.1
####System settings:
Oneplus 3, Android 9
