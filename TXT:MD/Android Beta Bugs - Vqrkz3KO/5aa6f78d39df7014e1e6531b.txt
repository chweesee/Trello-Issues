### Also happens using Search when jumping to a search result that is not the channel you're currently viewing, and personally I can also reproduce whzn jumping to a Recent mention (some can't repro this though)

### Can still reproduce after updating to 6.3.6, this bug is either not fixed or the patch attempt failed. At least for me.

### Finally fixed, in 6.3.7

### Tested on Android Alpha 6.3.7:

I can no longer reproduce this myself. Quickswitcher works just fine for me regardless of what server I point it to. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2018-03-14T19:40:32.731Z


### Closing out this ticket as it's been in a resolved state for 30 or more days with no additional reproductions or new steps. - Jared on 2018-07-06T21:19:37.754Z
