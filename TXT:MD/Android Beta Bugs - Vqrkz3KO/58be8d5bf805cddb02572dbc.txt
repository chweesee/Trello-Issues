### Can reproduce.
Samsung Galaxy S5 Note, Android Stable 10.4.2 (1039) - Bug does not occur when using emojis cross-server, only when using custom emojis native to a server.  Bug does not occur with *animated* emojis regardless of origin server (though I recommend someone who actually has Nitro confirm this, as I had to work secondhand).
