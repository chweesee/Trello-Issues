####Steps to reproduce:
- make sure there is no invite in the server settings "instant invites" section  
- create an invite 
- toggle never expiering 
- delete the 24h invite 
- create a new invite 
- toggle never expiering a few times on and off, [the "old" never expiering link will appear if its toggled on] 
- as soon as you leave the "create invite box", make sure "never expiering" is toggled on 
- observe "instant invites" in server settings

####Expected result:
the 24h link should be listed above the "never expiering" link, because it is newer
####Actual result:
the "never expiering" link is listed at the top
####Client settings:
Alpha 7.6.0
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini Android 6.0.1
