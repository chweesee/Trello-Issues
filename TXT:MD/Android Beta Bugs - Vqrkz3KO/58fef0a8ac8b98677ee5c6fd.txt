Reported by Krotchmonster#9387

####Steps to reproduce: 
- (I'll use online status for the example but it the same works for other things such as the server settings popup) 
- Open the channel drawer 
- Tap on your profile picture and then tap the right side of the screen where the drawer is not right before the window pops up (where you would tap to close the drawer, this also might take a few tries depending on your timing) 

####Expected result:
 The pop up is unable to open on top of the chat screen, and it only opens over the channel drawer 
####Actual result:
 The pop up is able to open over the chat 
####System settings:
 Android 5.0, Discord 3.7.4
