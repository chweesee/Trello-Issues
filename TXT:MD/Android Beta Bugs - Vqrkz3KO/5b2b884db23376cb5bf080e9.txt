Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a server where you have the following permissions: Kick, Ban, Manage nicknames 
- Select a user in member list and enter Manage User 
- Toggle split screen (Android 7+ only)

####Expected result:
Kick/Ban options should display correctly, and nickname field should not appear locked unless you actually don't have perms to edit them
####Actual result:
Username in Kick/Ban options are replaced by a weird string of symbols, and the lock icon will appear next to Nickname field regardless of your actual permsissions. In addition to that there are also things disappearing like the role list, but that's a known bug with split screen.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.9.6
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
