####Steps to reproduce:

- Try to connect to the same voice channel on your mobile device 
- "Connect to Voice" screen appears with list of people in channel, including yourself 
- Tap the 3-dot menu by your name 

####Expected result:
 It brings you to your account settings like everywhere else in the app 
####Actual result:
 You see your user settings and can tap through to your profile, can attempt to message yourself and send yourself a friend request (both of which fail/give errors)

### Can reproduce.
Samsung Galaxy J7 running Android 7.0 | Discord Alpha 6.6.0 | I used different steps to reproduce: hold to open your mini user profile (either DMs or in a server), and select settings as fast as possible. You should see a button to add yourself as a friend and a button to message yourself. You should also see a place to add a note and connected accounts at the bottom.
