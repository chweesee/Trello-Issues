####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to any channel (You might have to try multiple different channels.  It doesn't seem to always happen) 
- Tap the 3 dots in the top right 
- Tap channel settings 
- Now try to exit

####Expected result:
You just exit without anything about unsaved changes (And sometimes you can as I said above)
####Actual result:
Sometimes it will say something about unsaved changes when you try to exit
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.8.8
####System settings:
Moto G Play with Android 7.1.1
