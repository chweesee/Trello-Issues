Reported by B a ‚Ñ¢ a n#7883

####Steps to reproduce:
- Search for messages sent by a user (I did from:Dabbit Prime#0896) 
- Press the back button present on the top left of the screen 
- Immediately click on the magnifying glass again. This has to be done almost instantly to reproduce the bug

####Expected result:
It should display all 4 search options and your recent searches
####Actual result:
The in: option and your recent searches are missing until you reopen search. Bug is kinda inconsistent, I could reproduce 4/6 times.
####Client settings:
Android alpha 6.3.8
####System settings:
OnePlus 5, Android 8.0
