Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go in a server you have permission to create text channels, preferably without Administrator permission

- Open the menu to create a new channel 

- Enable "Private channel" 

- Without selecting any role, tap the checkmark to submit channel creation

####Expected result:
As on Desktop, you shouldn't even be able to submit the channel creation until you select at least 1 role
####Actual RESULT:
The app lets you submit it, and that will create a channel that nobody can see, except for admins/owner. This means that if you don't have Administrator privileges, you won't even be able to see the channel you just created.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.3.7
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0
