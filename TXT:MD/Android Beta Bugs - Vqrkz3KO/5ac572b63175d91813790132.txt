####Steps to reproduce:
- Let's imagine you want to send the following message : `Hello! My name is Dabbit.` 
- Choose a channel and start to type the message: `Hello! My nam` (cut here) 
- Let's consider you need to search for a message immediately, it cannot wait for you to finish typing the messqge. Tap the magnifying glass and search for anything 
- In the search results, pick any message and jump to it 
- Go back to the channel you were typing the message in 
- Finish typing your message and send it 
- Now, minimize Discord using the Home button of your phone 
- Re-open Discord using the shortcut icon on your homescreen (NOT VIA MULTI-TASKING) 
- Look at the textfield

####Expected result:
The textfield should stay empty
####Actual result:
It's filled with the half typed out message, (in this example, `Hello! My nam`)
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.4.6
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0
