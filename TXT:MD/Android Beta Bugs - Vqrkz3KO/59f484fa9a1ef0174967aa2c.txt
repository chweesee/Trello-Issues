[Archived] (Android 7.0+, possibly Huawei specific but unsure) Splitting your screen while Discord is active will make some UI elements diseappear, until you scroll the screen a bit. Bahavior is a bit different depending on which screen you are viewing (https://trello.com/c/NFBvwjwW)

P3 - Will be fixed eventually,

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Let's consider 3 cases: 
- Case 1) View any text channel, DM, or friend list 
- Split your screen using the Android 7.0 feature 
- Case 2) View any settings page or user profile (e.g Server settings)  
- Split your screen 
- Case 3 (more specific)) View Recent mentions 
- Split your screen, and then restore your screen back

####Expected result:
In all cases, splitting your screen should have no effect on any UI elements
####Actual result:
In case 1, all UI elements are gone except the menu icon at the top left // In case 2, only some text and profile pictures diseappear // In case 3, it just removes the recent mentions content, but this time the content won't come back after restoring the screen.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 5.5.1
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0

### I can confirm this is **not** Huawei specific, it just doesn't seem to happen on Samsung devices.
