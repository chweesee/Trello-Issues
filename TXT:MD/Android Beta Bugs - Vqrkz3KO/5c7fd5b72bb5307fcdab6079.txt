Reported by The Lunala#6877

####Steps to reproduce:
- Have a poor internet connection (enough to get the in app notification). 
- Long press on the connection  problems in app notification and slide your finger away from it. 
- Ask someone to DM/ping you somewhere. 
- Observe that no in app notifications appear. 
- Now, switch orientation to landscape and back to portrait (or keep it in landscape if you're comfortable). 
- Long press on the connection problems in app notification and slide your finger from it (because timer resets and restarts when switching orientation). 
- Now, ask someone to DM/ping you again somewhere.

####Expected result:
Either you do not in app notifications in both cases or get in both cases.
####Actual result:
You don't get in app notifications at first but after switching orientation, you start getting them.
