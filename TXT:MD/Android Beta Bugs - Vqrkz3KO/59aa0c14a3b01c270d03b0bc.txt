### This bug, as reported, either never existed or is already fixed.

There is a product-wide bug (read: including desktop) where if you join a voice channel, THEN you lose your "SPEAK" permission, you can still speak. There is an analogous bug where you gain SPEAK permission, you can't speak without leaving/rejoining.

Currently all platforms behave the same so filing this one as FIXED. - Andy Garron on 2018-01-20T01:08:08.287Z
