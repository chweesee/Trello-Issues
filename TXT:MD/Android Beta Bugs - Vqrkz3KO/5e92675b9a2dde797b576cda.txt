Reported by A1ex#8151

####Steps to reproduce:
- Invite a bot verified on its server (like Mee6) and do a command in a first channel.

- Go to a second channel, and do a command with an unverified bot ( multiple times).

- You will see at some point that the unverified bot will have the verified badge on one of the messages.
-If this doesn't work, go back to the first channel, then go back to the second channel and do multiple commands again.

####Expected result:
The unverified bot shouldn't have the verified badge.
####Actual result:
The unverified bot has the verified badge
####Client settings:
Discord 18.0-Alpha6 (1097)
####System settings:
