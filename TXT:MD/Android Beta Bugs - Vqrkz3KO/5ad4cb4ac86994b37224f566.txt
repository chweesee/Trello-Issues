####Steps to reproduce:
- (optional) Kill Discord to clear the debug log, and ensure that no error is shown already 
- Either minimize Discord using Home button and open another app, or open a link from Discord in order to open YouTube, Trello, etc. Either way, do NOT kill the app, leave it running in background 
- Go back to Discord and check debug log

####Expected result:
Nothing special to be seen there
####Actual result:
It's spammed with ` incorrect header check`. Number of times it's spammed may vary
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.4.9
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0
