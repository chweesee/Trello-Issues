####Steps to reproduce:
- For example, let's simulate a case. Let's say you and MR.1 are admins in a server. Both of you join a voice channel with some people to talk about cats. And, then MR.1 wants to make a joke and server mute yourself. 
- In the mobile app you are not able to unmute or undeafen yourself. You need someone else to do it. Someone have to unmute yourself exactly how you was muted. 
- It is really weird, if you are the owner and your staff want to make jokes like this, and you cannot unmute yourself

####Expected result:
You should be able to access your UserSettings or a tab where you can unserver mute/deafen yourself
####Actual result:
There's no way to unserver mute/deafen yourself on mobile
####Client settings:
Android Alpha 4.0.7
####System settings:
Android KitKat 4.4.4, Tablet Allview VIVAH8LTE

### User 1 is admin
User 2 is admin

User 2 goes to the toilet, and his mum starts vacuuming when hes left his phone on couch
User 1 server mutes so that other dont have to hear the shitty vacuuming
User 2 comes back and notices hes server mutes and unmutes himself
