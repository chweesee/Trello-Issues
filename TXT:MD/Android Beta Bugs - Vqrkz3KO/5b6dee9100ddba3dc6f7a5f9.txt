Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Start or join a DM call with a Desktop user 
- Look at the persistent notification on your phone 
- Notice there's a deafen option. Tap on it

####Expected result:
It shouldn't be possible to deafen in a DM, so this option shouldn't be there to begin with. At least it should not be working
####Actual result:
The option to deafen is there and when you use it you can't hear anything, and the Desktop user will see a Deafen icon on his end
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.2.9
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
