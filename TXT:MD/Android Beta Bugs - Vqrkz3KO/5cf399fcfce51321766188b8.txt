####Steps to reproduce:
- Have nitro classic  
- Cancel your plan 
- Go to upgrade your plan 
- Observe the amount of money you will be charged on the modal (Note: I only tested this on yearly subscriptions that have been almost used up, so it might not work for monthly or newly subscribed plans.)

####Expected result:
It should show the prorated cost
####Actual result:
It doesn't show the prorated cost, but rather shows the full cost
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 9.0.5
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy Note 8, Android 9
