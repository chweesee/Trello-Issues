####Steps to reproduce:
- login to spotify with a new account that isn't linked to your discord (but have another one linked) 
- make sure you have "Display Spotify as your status" and "Device Broadcast Status" enabled 
- play a song 
- open discord and observe your profile

####Expected result:
just like on Desktop, status should not be shown unless the Spotify account you're using is linked to your discord
####Actual result:
the status is shown regardless of the used Spotify account
####Client settings:
Alpha 8.4.8
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy Note 8, Android 8.0
