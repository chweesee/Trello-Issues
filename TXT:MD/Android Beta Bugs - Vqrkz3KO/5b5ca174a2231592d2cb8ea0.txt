Reported by » a r i a#1593

####Steps to reproduce:
- look at a channel in a server (I tried with very active ones that had messages come in while I was reproing this bug) 
- go to a dm with someone (or group dm) 
- lock your phone and wait a few minutes (!, won't happen immediately) 
- unlock again and observe

####Expected result:
After unlocking, you will see the same channel you left off of
####Actual result:
After unlocking, you see the last dm you were in but after a second it jumps to the last server channel you viewed
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.2.0
####System settings:
OnePlus 6 (Version 8.1.0)

### Alternate steps that work everytime:
- Kill Discord completely
- Have someone send you a DM so you get a push mobile notification
- Click on the notification
You will be redirected to the DM and then one second later shooted back to last server
