####Steps to reproduce:

- Get moved to a voice channel where you have View Channel permission denied

####Expected result:
You should see the hidden voice channel in channel list while you are in it (works on Canary). Your old voice channel should not be highlighted in the list as you're no longer in there.
####Actual result:
You don't see the hidden voice channel in channel list, you can see you're connected to voice but you are not shown in any voice channel in channel list as the hidden channel is not shown. Old voice chanenl is still highlighted.
