### I can reproduce this bug by following these steps:
- Make sure you're not in the latest version of Discord
- Make sure in-app notifications are enabled (User Settings > Notifications)
- Update Discord to the latest version
Baiscally, updating Discord causes the in-app notifications to turn off automatically.
