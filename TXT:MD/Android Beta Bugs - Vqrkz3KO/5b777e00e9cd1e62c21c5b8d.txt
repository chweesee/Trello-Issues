When an @ everyone tag is sent in a very large server (5+digit member count), all Android users that have read the ping and closed Discord before the push notification has propagated will get a stuck ping (https://trello.com/c/rUPikMSR)

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:

- Make sure you don't have Discord running anywhere, except on your Android client which should be open 
- Have someone mention everyone or a role with a lot of people in it 
- As soon as you receive the ping: acknowledge it, add a reaction to the message (idk if it's required but that's what I did) and switch to a different channel. You must do all of that very quickly after receiving the ping! 
- Minimize Discord by using your Home button (don't kill the app) and lock your phone 
- Wait for a good 5 minutes, enough time for your previous Discord session to die. 
- Unlock your phone, and reconnect to Discord. The stuck ping should be there

####Expected result:
The mention should stay read
####Actual result:
The ping comes back and gets stuck: impossible to get rid of it, even when marking as read again, until you view it on Desktop or someone posts a new message in the channel.
####Client settings:
First reported on Discord Alpha 7.3.3, steps to reproduce last updated on Discord Alpha 8.8.4
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0

### In very large servers, there can be a huge delay between the moment when the @ everyone is posted and the moment when mobile push notification is received. This is the root cause: whenever you read a ping before the push notification has propagated, you will get the stuck ping upon reopening Discord.

### It is actually possible to clear the stuck ping using these steps:
- Mark whole server as read
- Kill Discord and restart
