####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to any new channel or channel without messages 
- Send a message  
- Go to any window that isn't that channel (I use the invite members screen) 
- Go back to the channel 
- See that the notification says the date correctly but the year is 1975

####Expected result:
It should say the year correctly
####Actual result:
It says the year is 1975
