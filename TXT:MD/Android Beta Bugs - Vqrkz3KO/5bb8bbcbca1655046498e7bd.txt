[Archived] When you change your username to a longer one, the name in the bottom of the channel drawer occupies as much space as the smaller one did before getting truncated. (https://trello.com/c/cTvcdJpH)

Reported by The Lunala#7777

####Steps to reproduce:
- Set your username to a longer one (make sure that the initial username was small enough not to get truncated and left a bit of space too). 
- Open channel drawer. 
- Observe the username at the bottom of the channel drawer.

####Expected result:
the username gets truncated where it has to i.e before the settings gear.
####Actual result:
the username gets truncated at the point where the old username ended. For example, you had a username with 3 characters and you changed it to have 8 characters. Then, only two characters are shown and the rest of the username gets truncated.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 762
####System settings:
Coolpad Mega 3, 6.0
