"Not sure if this is a bug or intention but when opening images from chat in a web browser, it doesn't include the file extension. I open in browsers to save since there isn't another way at the moment and after I save, I have to find the download and add the jpg extension myself. Whether this is a bug or working as intended, please create a way to save images without having to do the extra work of fixing the files. Example pictures attached below."

"Sony Xperia z5. Newest version of mobile Discord as far as I know. 
About a week ago I noticed that, when saving a file through Discord on mobile, it distorts the filename to such an extent that the file loses its type and has to be renamed entirely. Also means that anything I have saved from Discord cannot be reused until it's been through a computer or similar. It also seems like Discord deletes these files from my device if I upload them to a text chat."

Another report - Cole Norman on 2016-10-13T18:50:04.661Z


### I believe this is only happening w/ attachment type embeds (directly uploaded).

Linked embeds should be be saving using the original URL and not the discord proxy (the cause of the bug - our proxy service for images does not use file extensions and Android is too dumb to figure out it's an image).

A fix has been made and should be live in the next alpha 3.1.4 - Miguel Gaeta on 2016-10-24T08:01:44.579Z


### Fixed as per Miguel's comment. - Jared on 2017-01-20T23:49:50.502Z
