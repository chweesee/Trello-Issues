Short Description:
Instant Invite no longer works when the message it was linked in has been edited (even if you edit it multiple times to be the same again).
Steps to reproduce
1) Write a message with a link (or just a link).
2) Click it, the link works.
3) Edit this message (so it shows a small "edited" part) with word at end 
4) The instant invite link no longer works (is invalid or has expired popup)
Expected Result
The link should still work, as it does on the desktop version.
Actual Result
The link somehow becomes invalid due to the message having been edited.

** Note: if you edit at the start the link still works

### DJScuas and MikeSky can reproduce - Jared on 2016-12-17T01:02:11.115Z


### - 1. Generate (find) an instant invite of a server you're not part of yet. - 2. Click on it and see the normal popup "Join this server?". - 3. Edit the instant-invite link and remove one character (or more). - 4. Edit the instant-invite link AGAIN and re-add the characters you removed (so it's back to before you edited it). - 5. Try clicking it again. It'll give you a "The instant invite is invalid or has expired." popup.

### This ONLY happens if the text is added AFTER the instant invite. Like for example: "https://discord.gg/NQ8u48x hello" (without "")

### Tested on 3.7.3:

Hey look, it's my own bug from ways back!

I can no longer reproduce this whatever I try. Edited it with words behind it, before it, edited the invite by breaking it (removing a letter) and then re-adding it with another edit.. It always worked on my end. - Alexander (DJScias) on 2017-04-24T22:36:18.197Z
