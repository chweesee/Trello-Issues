Reported by üåàKipperdoodlesüç©üçå#2908

####Steps to reproduce:
- Download Discord 
- Sign in 
- close app 
- open app 
- crash occurs

####Expected result:
Discord should open normally and be usable
####Actual result:
Discord has stopped, If you force close the app and then open again it will never properly open. The only time you can sign in and use app successfully is after fresh install or clearing cache and then signing in again. Eventually the app will start crashing again once the background process ends. People say that it isn't supported because Android O is beta, however the public release is rumored to be next week.
####Client settings:
Mobile Android 4.0.2
####System settings:
Google Pixel 8.0.0, Build Number: OPP4.170623.014
