### @lytefast Despite your comment I don't really understand how this is intended. When you have no results in the invite user list, not only the results disappear, but also the searchbar itself. That's basically what the report is saying. Just in case you misunderstood it, let me explain why we thought it was clearly a bug and why we filed it:
1) After the searchbar goes invisible, the keyboard stays open. This gives the impression that you can type in the void, and that you can still soemhow interact with the searchbar without seeing it. 
2) While you're in this state, pressing Backspace on the keyboard might bring back the searchbar, because it actually erases characters from your search query
3) If you close your keyboard after an unsuccessful search, there is no way to bring it back. You are forced to close the invite screen entirely and reopen it in order to perform a new search. Not really nice in terms of user experience :/
4) It is inconsistent with Desktop behavior, as well as with other search engines anywhere else in the app (quick switcher, message searching, bans searching, etc don't hide the searchbar when you have no results)
