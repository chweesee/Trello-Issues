Reported by brilaverance#2835

####Steps to reproduce:
- have a user block you 
- go to a second party application (such as messages) 
- share an image/file to discord and attempt to send the file to the user who has you blocked 
- notice the toast is absent compared to when attempting to send a text or message to said user

####Expected result:
the toast 'Unable to pre-process file' should appear as it does when sending a message or text.
####Actual result:
the screen loads longer than normal and no toast appears
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.4.0 (740)
####System settings:
Google Pixel 2, Android 9.0.0
