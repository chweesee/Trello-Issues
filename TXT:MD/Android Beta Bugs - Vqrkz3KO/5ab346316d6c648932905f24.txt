### This ticket was reported as part of the CNR event with the information that `This is caused by a bug in an older version of FX file explorer, it has been fixed in latest versions.` which if true (I have no reason to doubt it) means the bug is invalid regardless. Which means that this is not valid for the event. - Jared on 2018-04-23T22:50:29.307Z


### Archived due to being in the CNR list for a month without any further action to make place for newer bugs. - Tarek on 2018-05-24T18:13:03.205Z
