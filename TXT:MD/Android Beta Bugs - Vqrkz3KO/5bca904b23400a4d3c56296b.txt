Reported by The Lunala#7777

####Steps to reproduce:
- Search something that gives 150+ results. 
- Scroll all the way to the bottom.

####Expected result:
The bottom-most message is the first message that contains the search query.
####Actual result:
The bottom most message isn't the first message that contains the search query. When you click on it and scroll up, you'll find more messages that fit your search query but aren't listed in the search results.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 771
####System settings:
Lenovo vibe K5+, 5.1.1
