####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a lazy guild you can manage 
- Kill Discord 
- Reopen Discord 
- Don't open member list, go straight to Server settings 
- Go to Members 
- Notice there are a lot of missing people 
- Now go back, and open and close the sidebar member list (no need to scroll down, just open and close) 
- Go back to server settings member list. Now everyone is here

####Expected result:
Everyone should be here no matter if you opened the sidebar member list first or not
####Actual result:
You need to open the sidebar memeber list one before all users can be displayed in server settings
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.6.7
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
