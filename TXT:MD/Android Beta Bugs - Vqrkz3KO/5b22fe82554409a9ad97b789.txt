### This is not a Discord bug, but a OnePlus 6 and 6T's mic issue. One OnePlus 6 and 6T, in third-party applications, uses Noise Cancelling (top mic) in default, which interferes with the bottom microphone. Unfortunately, the top mic will reduce the quality of the microphone pretty badly on third-party applications, some to the point of not recognizing the microphone at all. Also, OnePlus 6/6T users cannot choose which microphone to use, which means the issue is the device's issue, not Discord issue. Until the device users can choose which microphone to use, or the bottom microphone becomes the default microphone, this issue will not be fixed.
