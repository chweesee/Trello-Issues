####Steps to reproduce:
- Open up server notification settings 
- Change the notification settings using the option boxes on the very right 
- They act like check boxes and settings won't change 
- They won't get unselected either 
- It will only be changed when clicking on the desired option's name and description

####Expected result:
You should be able to change the setting using the option boxes
####Actual result:
You can only change the setting using the name but not on the option boxes
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.1.5
####System settings:
LG Q6, Android 7.1.1
