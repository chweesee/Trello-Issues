####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to Settings > Appearance 
- Make sure Sync across client is ON (won't work if it's already OFF) 
- Change the theme (aka the unselected option), and toggle OFF the switch at the exact same time

####Expected result:
Both theme and sync options should switch normally
####Actual result:
You can see that both Light and Dark theme are selected, and you cannot switch themes anymore, unless you close Appearance and open again
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.9.5
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
