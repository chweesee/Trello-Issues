### Can repro on Canary as well, this looks like a markdown formatting thing though.  - Clayton on 2017-07-19T23:43:31.027Z

### yep that is correct @clayton301 this is consistent with desktop and is therefore just "how discord markdown works" at the moment. - Andy Garron on 2017-07-21T05:47:38.555Z


### Archiving as this ticket as been Won't Fix for over a month. - Mike Nisbet on 2017-10-17T21:12:24.596Z

### This Behaviour seems to be fixed on Desktop, but continues to happen on Android. Since the Won't Fix Reason was given based on Consistency with the Desktop Client, I'm moving this back.
