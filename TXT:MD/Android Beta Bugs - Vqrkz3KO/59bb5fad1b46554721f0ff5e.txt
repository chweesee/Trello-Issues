### Moved from User Reported Bugs to Serious Issues by Cole Norman on 2017-09-16T02:07:45.472Z


### this is because updating from Alpha 5.1.5 to 5.1.6 your selection for either "Voice Activity" or  "Push to Talk" was removed and neither are selected in the "Voice" tabin your User Settings, selecting one will fix this
