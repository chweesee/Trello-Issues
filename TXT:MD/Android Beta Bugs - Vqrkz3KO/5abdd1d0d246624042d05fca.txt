####Steps to reproduce:
- Go in a server with Manage channels 
- Create a new category and give it a super long name 
- Go to Server settings > Channels 
- Tap on the button top right and select Category Sort Mode

####Expected result:
The name should be cut off with "..." as for regular channels
####Actual result:
The name overlaps the two lines that you're supposed to hold down to sort the category
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.4.5
####System settings:
