None

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Enable Google Smart Lock autofill service in your phone settings (I think it's only available on Android 6+) 
- Go to User settings > My account, change your password and go back. If you did step 1 correctly, it should prompt you to save your password in Smart Lock. Accept. 
- Create a new text channel, and name it `#password` 
- Send a message mentionning the channel (`#password`) and click the channel link to jump to it 
- Focus the textfield and try to send a message

####Expected result:
Google Smart Lock should never flag the chat textfield as a username or password field
####Actual result:
Google Smart Lock is triggered on channels named such as `#username`, `#password`, `#email`, `#mobile`, etc
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.9.9
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
