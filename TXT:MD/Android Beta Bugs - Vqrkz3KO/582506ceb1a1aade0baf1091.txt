### Okori believes this to be an issue specific to the Samsung Galaxy S2, a phone which launched in 2011 and we do not have in stock. I haven't received any reports of this issue for almost a year now and this device will be unsupported with the next OS update, so it's not worth fixing anyway.

I'll give Okori half credit for trying, but this ticket will be archived with the remainder. - Jared on 2017-10-30T14:48:15.184Z
