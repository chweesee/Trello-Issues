[Archived] If you have an app installed in your device and click on a link in Discord that opens that app but open the link with Chrome (which should open it in the custom chrome tab if you have them enabled) and click on the kebab menu and click on open with chrome and select chrome and come back to Discord, the custom chrome tab remains open.

P3 - Will be fixed eventually

Reported by The Lunala#6877

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Settings>Behaviour and select use Custom chrome tabs if you haven't already. 
- Install an application (say Trello). 
- Click on a link that opens the app from Discord (say the link to a bug report). 
- In the open with application sheet, select Chrome. 
- After custom chrome tab opens, click on the kebab menu and select open with chrome. 
- After the link gets opened in Chrome, open recent apps and go to Discord from there. 
- Observe that the custom chrome tab remains open. 
- Now, do the same steps after uninstalling the app.

####Expected result:
When you have the app installed, going back to Discord from the custom chrome tab should close it.
####Actual result:
It doesn't close it.
####Client settings:
