Android 4.4.2, Discord Alpha 3.2.8; seems to require not pressing on message text or timestamp; if successful, the message won't get highlighted.

### Can reproduce.
Tapping on the right side of the message, on the same line as the mention reproduces the bug. 2nd described step doesn't (will likely be edited after approved)

### The whole long press thing needs a rewrite. It's far too finicky.  - Jared on 2017-02-07T18:28:47.910Z


### Moved from User Reported Bugs to Verified Bugs by Jared on 2017-02-07T18:28:51.297Z


### Can reproduce.
Android discord 3.9.0

It works not only with mentions, but with any clickable links too (urls, for example). This bug is caused by wrong bounding box size of clickable objects when they are at the end of messages. And not only the long press is affected, but a short press will be referred to the link instead of the message too.

### Can still reproduce as of 7/28. - Jared on 2017-07-28T22:12:29.543Z
