Reported by Ori#1908

####Steps to reproduce:
- You have to be connected in voice call in DM to anyone. 
- Go to a random server and a random text Channel, Search in message history any word, and click on any of the old results to jump to that time of chat, then open top left drawer and go to another channel of other server and do the same. (Don't click on "you're viewing older messages" banner at the bottom) 
- Open drawer again and go to DM call, click on small arrow button on bottom right so to open person's profile saying ongoing call 
- Click on back button to go back to DM chat.

####Expected result:
When you press back the button, it should return to DM chat.
####Actual result:
It shows all those search history results which you searched earlier in those servers.
####Client settings:
Discord Beta 6.5.6
####System settings:
Xiaomi Mi A1, Android 8.0.0
