####Steps to reproduce:
- Switch to dark theme ( because the server name and channel name are invisible in the VC bar on light theme). 
- Set your font size to the maximum value possible. 
- Join a VC. 
- Get out of the VC and enter a text channel and close keyboard. 
- Observe the server and channel name.

####Expected result:
They aren't cut off.
####Actual result:
They are cut off from the bottom.
####Client settings:
