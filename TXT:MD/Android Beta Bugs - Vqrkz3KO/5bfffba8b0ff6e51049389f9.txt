####Steps to reproduce:
- Open search in a channel 
- Use the ``in:`` filter 
- Type in a ``#`` and then observe that the channels eligible are shown 
- Type in another character to filter from channels 
- Notice how all the filtered results go away as if you typed something invalid

The suggestions dissapear even if you typed something valid
