### This is actually more of an incomplete design than a strict bug. We're going to be revamping this screen to be more clear in the future, that will be our fix for this. - Jared on 2017-02-03T18:44:10.564Z

### This seems to have been fixed. If you tap on a user's profile, you now have the options to Server Deafen and Server Mute them.
