Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to any server and tap Search 
- Input `from:` 
- Input the Discord tag of an uncached user. If you're not sure of which user to pick, you can also input the tag of a user who isn't in the server

####Expected result:
As on Desktop, it should threat the invalid tag as the content of the search and the "from:" is ignored
####Actual result:
"Crap, we dropped the manifying glass. Uh... can you try searching again?" coming with a 400 error in debug log. Notice that the request parameters has `author_id=null`, which seems unintended
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.9.1
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
