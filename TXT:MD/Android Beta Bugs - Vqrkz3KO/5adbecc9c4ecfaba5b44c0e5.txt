Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Write a message with a content that the Android system is able to parse into a link. For example, a link without HTTP, a phone number, or a Google Map address 
- Send the message, you will see it working as normal (the content will render as a clickable link 
- Now either edit the message, or create a new one with the same content, and add a codeblock anywhere in the message (works with both single line and multi line codeblocks) 
- Send and observe

####Expected result:
Content recognition feature of Android should work regardless of the presence of a codeblock
####Actual result:
Android won't parse content if a codeblock is present
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.5.5
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0
