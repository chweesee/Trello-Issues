Reported by Snissel#6141

####Steps to reproduce:
- Send a message with a random emoji 
- Somewhere in the middle of that emoji text, put another emoji

####Expected result:
It should send the emoji that is placed in the middle, as it indicates that it is a emoji
####Actual result:
It won't send a single emoji, but just break the one placed in the middle as a code
####Client settings:
6.0.2
####System settings:
Oneplus 5T, Android 7.1.1
