Reported by Ana940#9858

####Steps to reproduce:
- Click on the media icon 
- Attach an image 
- Don't send, but click off it, it displays as a preview above the textbox  
- Click on the preview (which deletes it from the attachment bar)  
- Notice the attachment bar doesn't go, there's still the cross to delete all attachments there, etc.  
- Type in the textbox

####Expected result:
Attachment bar should go when no attachments there
####Actual result:
Attachment bar stays until something is typed in the textbox
####Client settings:
Android 18.0-alpha4 (1095)
####System settings:
Moto G5, Android 8.1.0
