Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Pick any server, preferably without acces to Server settings and change nickname so you can see the Provacy settings option without having to scroll down 
- Make sure that DMs from members of this server are *enabled* 
- Long-press on this server in the server list and observe closely the Privacy settings toggle

####Expected result:
The toggle shouldn't animate
####Actual result:
It animates like if the option was toggling itself on.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 5.9.5
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0

7308

### Can reproduce.
CR Samsung Galaxy S6, 7.0, 595, I also believe that this is somewhat related to https://trello.com/c/SIZ5k8e2/765 as both involve the settings icon "flickering" briefly. Very briefly in the case of 7308
