Reported by J1#0088

####Steps to reproduce:
- have a hw keyboard connected to your device 
- go to Settings > My account then click enable 2FA 
- skip to the last step then click on the first digit text box 
- press tab on your keyboard

####Expected result:
it should select the next selectable thing, which is the Back button
####Actual result:
it skips the whole process then show you the : tada : screen lol as if you've successfully activated 2FA (only visually ofc. possibly caused by the app selecting the Done button from the last step instead which causes this issue)
####Client settings:
Alpha 8.5.4
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy Note 8, Android 8.0
