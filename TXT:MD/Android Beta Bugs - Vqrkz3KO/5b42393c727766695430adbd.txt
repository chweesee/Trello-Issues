Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a server with kick or ban permission 
- Open someone's mini profile 
- Tap Manage User 
- Scroll down to below roles where Kick, Ban and Transfer Ownership options are located 
- Open either Kick or Ban modal 
- Focus Reason textfield 
- Tap outside the modal to close it

####Expected result:
Both modal and keyboard should close
####Actual result:
Only the modal closes but not the keyboard. Note that it doesn't happen when using the Kick and Ban option directly on mini profile, only happens in user management screen
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.0.5
####System settings:
