[Archived] When the server you are currently viewing gets suddenly unavailable because of an outage, you will be redirected to a "ghost" server with no channels and no name instead of being redirected to your friends list (https://trello.com/c/U7xa5oD0)

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- View any server 
- Wait for it to be unavailable because of an outage (good luck...)

####Expected result:
It should behave the same as if you were kicked from the server: you will be redirected to your friends list screen
####Actual result:
You are redirected to an empty server with no channels, no name... Also when you try to open the 3 dots menu (where you can usually find notification settings, leave server, etc), the menu only appears for a split second
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 5.7.4
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0

### Can reproduce.
Approving to force this through the queue otherwise it'll stay forever. However, this behavior is Won't Fix. While I agree it's not the best design, it's a design decision and not a bug.
