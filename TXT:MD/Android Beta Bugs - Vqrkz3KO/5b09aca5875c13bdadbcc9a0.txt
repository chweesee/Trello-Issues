### As of Alpha 6.9.5 I can repro again with a bit different steps:
- Open Member list and Channel drawer at the same time
- Switch to a server and then immediately switch to another server before the other one finished loading members. Both servers must not have their members already cached, so a Discord restart might be required before doing this. Also a slow connection is helpful in case member list loads so fast that you can't keep up.
