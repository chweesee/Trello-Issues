####Steps to reproduce:
- Step 1: Someone sends you a dm while you are viewing the conversation and switch to a server. 
- Step 2: open multitasking and switch to another app like chrome. 
- Step 3: Get back into discord via multitasking and you will still see a DM notification  that should have been gone by then.

####Expected result:
After viewing the message, the red notification should be gone when you multitask and come  back into the app.
####Actual result:
the red notification is present when you come back from the multitasking into the discord app.
####Client settings:
Discord alpha (Version 4.1.1)
####System settings:
Android 7.1.1 on Moto Z play (droid)

### This is not related to the bug bounty that was previously linked. In that bug bounty the client wouldn't update with the message until the app was force closed and restarted. - Jared on 2017-08-30T17:06:37.733Z
