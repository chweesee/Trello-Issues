Reported by Lunʌrᴮᵒᵗ#0002

####Steps to reproduce:
- put text around a triple code block (I used test #1)

- edit the message to where it has only one tick on each side

- observe closely (best if you compare it to a message that is surrounded by one tick without it being edited, I used Test #2)

####Expected result:
the black box should be the same as if you just put one tick around the text
####Actual result:
the black box is higher than expected and it looks like the text is kinda bigger
####Client settings:
Discord alpha 6.5.5
####System settings:
K20 V, Android 7.0
