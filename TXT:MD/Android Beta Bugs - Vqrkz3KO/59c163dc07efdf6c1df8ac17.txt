####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a server you have the Manage Roles permission for 
- Open the profile of a Nitro user with an animated avatar on mobile 
- Wait for the user's profile to fully load 
- Give the user a role on desktop

####Expected result:
The user's animated avatar should not flash and the user details should just be updated with the user's new role
####Actual result:
The user's avatar flashes, not an instance of lazy loading because the information was already on screen
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 5.1.9 (519) and Discord Canary 0.0.163 (Build 4429)
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy S8 (SM-G950F), Android Nougat 7.0 and Windows 10 Home 64-bit v1703
