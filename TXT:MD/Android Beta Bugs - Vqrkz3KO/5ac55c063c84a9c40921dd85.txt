Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to any channel and tap Search 
- Quickly double tap on one of the four filters

####Expected result:
It should insert only one, **as the filter suggesions are supposed to disappear as soon as one is inserted**
####Actual result:
There's a small delay before filters disappear, letting you insert twice if you're fast enough
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.4.6
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0
