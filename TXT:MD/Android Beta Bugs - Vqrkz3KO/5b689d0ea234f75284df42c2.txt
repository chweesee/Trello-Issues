####Steps to reproduce:
- Turn on game detection if you haven't already 
- Open recent apps 
- Kill Discord 
- Wait for about 5 seconds 
- Note that this doesn't happen if you have just turned on game detection

####Expected result:
Nothing. It should close and that's it
####Actual result:
System reports that Discord has stopped because it could not start the GameDetectionService and crashes. You could no longer receive notifications as well. The crash dialog could show up twice if you were to receive a notification (which wouldn't appear)
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 726
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime, LineageOS 15.1 (Oreo 8.1)
