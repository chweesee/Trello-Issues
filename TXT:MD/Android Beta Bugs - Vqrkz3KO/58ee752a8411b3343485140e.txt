### Can reproduce.
Nexus 9 Android 7.1 , Alpha 3.6.3. However this is the correct behaviour for both left and right sidebars if held at the edge at any point, the back button is just simply interfering with that action

### Super annoying, will investigate a fix for this as we get some breathing room. Should be fixed in some way prior to stable release, this is anti-juice. - Andy Garron on 2017-04-12T21:19:23.947Z
