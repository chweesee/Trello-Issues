Short Description:  Fuzzy search is not used in the servers member list similar to desktop.
Steps to Reproduce:
1)  Open up members list in server settings (and bans I assume)
2)  Try to fuzzy search someone
Expected Result: User is found with fuzzy search similar to how they are found in desktop.
Actual Result: There is no fuzzy search.

More information: Me and andyG talked about this, the reasoning behind it is that desktop caches the users when you first load the members list (all of them even 10k servers etc) so that they can be fuzzy searched from memory instead of using a server side fuzzy search. 

System Settings:  Android Alpha, Android N, Nexus 6P
