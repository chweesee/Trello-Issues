Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to a text channel with send message perms 
- Write any text containing [colon]1[colon]

####Expected result:
It shouldn't convert to emoji, because the correct emoji alias is `+1` not `1`, also it doesn't happen on Desktop client
####Actual result:
On Android it's converted to emoji. This is particularly annoying in codeblocks because when I wanted to share a certain string of data to a friend last day, it messed up because some sections of the string was made of `:`'s and `1`'s. I had to grab my PC and send it from the Desktop client to do it
