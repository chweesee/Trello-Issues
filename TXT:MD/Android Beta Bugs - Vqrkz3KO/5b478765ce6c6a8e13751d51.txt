####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a bot that shows images in a rich embed. 
- Type and send the command that gives the embed with the image. 
- As soon as you see some sort of changes like the chat scrolling, scroll up (not too much). [ You need to be real quick for this step. ]. 
- Scoll down.

####Expected result:
When you scroll down, the embed should have the image.
####Actual result:
The embed doesn't have the image.
