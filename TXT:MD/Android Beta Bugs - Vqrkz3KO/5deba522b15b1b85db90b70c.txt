####Steps to reproduce:
- Find someone you can't dm (one where Clyde sends the 'you can't dm this person' block of text) 
- Send some messages. 
- Mark Clyde's messages as unread before it deletes them. 
- That's it. Unless the person adds you or allows you to DM them, it will stay there indefinitely. There will always be a notification from that person.

####Expected result:
Direct message notification should disappear.
####Actual result:
Direct message notification stays there.
####Client settings:
9.9.5
####System settings:
Android, Samsung Galaxy A7, Android 8.0.0

### Muting their DMs keeps the ping, and the next time you open Discord their PFP will show up again under friends tab.
