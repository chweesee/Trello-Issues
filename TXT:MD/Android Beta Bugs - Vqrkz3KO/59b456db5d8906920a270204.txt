Reported by Rauf#3260

####Steps to reproduce:
- make a role with default color 
- go to create a channel 
- select the option to make it private 
- look at list of roles

####Expected result:
The role name should be the default gray/grey
####Actual result:
It defaults to pure black (#000000), due to this hex being a placeholder for the default role color.
####Client settings:
Android Alpha 5.1.4 (514)
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy S2, LineageOS 14.1 (Android 7.1.2)
