####Steps to reproduce:
- This requires you to have 2FA enabled  
- Scale your font to 80% 
- Go to "My Account" and observe the "ENABLED" text and the green padlock icon

####Expected result:
The "ENABLED" text should be centered/aligned properly with the green padlock icon just like when the font is scaled to to 100% and 150%
####Actual result:
The "ENABLED" isn't centered but is aligned a little upwards
####Client settings:
