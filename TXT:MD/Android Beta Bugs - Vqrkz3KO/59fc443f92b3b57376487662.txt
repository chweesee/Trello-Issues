[Archived] [Android 6.0 and newer] Revoking permission from the app to use the camera during a video call will disconnect you brutally from the call instead of switching back to voice-only mode. (https://trello.com/c/NTGtjmxo)

####Steps to reproduce:
- Start a DM call with another Android device (haven't tested with Android <=> Desktop)  
- Enable video mode 
- While the video call is running, go to your App Manager and revoke permission from Discord to use the camera 
- Re-open Discord

####Expected result:
Since Discord can't access to the camera anymore, it should automatically toggle off the video mode and you will be able to continue the call in voice-only. Alternatively, you should be disconnected but *in a proper way*
####Actual result:
It brutally disconnects you from the call : your recipient will see a frozen image of the video instead of indicating that you left the call
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 5.5.4
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0

### Should be NAB; you're not supposed to revoke permissions during runtime. Procedure should involve Force Close first. User error. A fatal disconnect error is expected, as Java begins throwing exceptions. This probably also breaks other things in app too.

### I agree, but such exceptions can still be handled.

### This sounds like intentionally destructive behavior, low priority. - Jared on 2017-11-07T00:02:55.326Z


### Verified. But I'm calling this a Won't Fix. - Jared on 2017-11-07T18:51:30.677Z
