####Steps to reproduce:
- Have someone mention you by putting a backslash (e.g `\@Alex1304#0000`) 
- Have him send the message with this content in chat

####Expected result:
The message should appear highlighted for you, since you are still getting pinged.
####Actual result:
The message isn't highlighted. If you view that same message on Desktop, it is.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.3.7
