####Steps to reproduce:
- Be in a server with several channels with the same name. For example, DTesters has two channels named "rules" 
- Go to Search 
- Select the `in:` filter 
- Type "rules". Both channels will show up in autocomplete. Select any and submit the query 
- Now go back, and make a new search. Type the same thing as before, but this time select the other rules channel in the suggestions (the one you haven't selected the first time) 
- Submit and observe results

####Expected result:
It should show results for the other channel
####Actual result:
It shows results for the same channel
