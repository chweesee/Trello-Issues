Reported by Fayne Aldan#2423

####Steps to reproduce:
- Make sure Discord is opened and active, and that you are not connected to any voice channel yet
- Turn on Airplane mode or disable Wifi/Mobile data
- Try to connect to a voice channel

####Expected result:
Nothing happens, or maybe should display an error message saying Failed/Unable to conect
####Actual Result:
When you click Connect nothing happens at first, but when you go back to the chat you can see a "Disconnected... " with a loading icon below the chat box, and you can't get rid of it until you enable your internet back or restart the app.
####Client settings:
Beta 3.9.6
####System settings:
Android 7.0, LG K20 PLUS
