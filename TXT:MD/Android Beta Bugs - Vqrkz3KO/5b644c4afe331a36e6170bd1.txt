Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to Quick Switcher  
- Input an asterisk 
- Observe server list

####Expected result:
Should either be sorted from last to first visited server (that would make more sense), alternatively they can be sorted alphabetically or by the same order they are in main server list
####Actual result:
No sort is applied at all
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.2.3
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
