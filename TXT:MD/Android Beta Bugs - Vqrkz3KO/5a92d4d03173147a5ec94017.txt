Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Set your theme to Dark 
- Be in a role with Manage channels but not Administrator 
- Have an admin set permissions override in a channel so your role has more perms in it 
- Go to Channel settings > Permissions > Your role

####Expected result:
The permission that you can't revoke because "it would remove it from you" should be just grayed out
####Actual result:
They have a background color that doesn't fit Dark theme at all
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 6.2.8
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0
