### Can reproduce.
Sorting channels also doesn't scroll down properly. If you have a full channel list and try to drag a selected channel to the bottom it will not go all the way down. Samsung Galaxy S6, 7.0, 541

### Can reproduce.
CR, Huawei Mate 9 Android 7.0 Discord Alpha 5.4.1. When there are really a lot of channels (>30), it doesn't move directly to the top, but the scrolling is not smooth at all

### This only seems to happen when there's multiple categories and/or over 10 channels below the scrolling point.
