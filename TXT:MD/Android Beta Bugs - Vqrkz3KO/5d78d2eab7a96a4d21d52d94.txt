####Steps to reproduce:
- Go to Samsung Game Launcher, and go to Discord button. 
- Scroll down to Popular Discord Server, and choose a server that you aren't currently in (Fortnite recommended). 
- You should be led back to Discord on a lurk mode. Notice the VC channels, and how public VCs are unlocked. 
- EXTRA STEP (NOT NECESSARY) 
- To check the difference between desktop, go to server discovery and check the same server you are on mobile. Notice how all VCs are locked on desktop but open on mobile.

####Expected result:
All VCs are supposed to be locked.
####Actual result:
Public VCs that aren't tied to a role permission is unlocked. Pressing "Connect to voice" will not do anything on the screen itself, but once you exit the VC channel screen, it will say "Disconnected" at the bottom. Check the images for the difference between desktop and mobile.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 9.4.9
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy S9, Android 9.0
