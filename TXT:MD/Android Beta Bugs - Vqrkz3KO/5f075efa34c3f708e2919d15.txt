####Steps to reproduce:
- Upload at least one emoji to a server

- Open the emoji picker in the app and scroll to the server's emojis

- Delete all the emojis on another device, observing the emoji picker while you delete the last one

####Expected result:
The deletion of the last emoji propagates and the server is removed from the emoji picker
####Actual result:
The (now deleted) last emoji remains in the emoji picker, and talking or reacting with it won't work.
####Client settings:
Android Beta 24 (1150)
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy S10+, Android 10
