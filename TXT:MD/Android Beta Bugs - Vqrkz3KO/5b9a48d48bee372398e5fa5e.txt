[Archived] If you're far back in the message history and the latest message in the channel has a tall image attached, jumping to present by tapping "You're viewing older messages" doesn't work properly (https://trello.com/c/wQjWc72B)

Reported by Alex1304#9704

####Steps to reproduce:
- Post a tall image in any channel 
- Scroll up until you get the "You're viewing older messages" 
- Jump back to present by tapping the banner

####Expected result:
You should be taken all the way at the bottom of the chat
####Actual result:
It places you so the content of the last message is at middle of the screen, so you need to scroll down through the tall image to actually jump to present
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 7.4.9
####System settings:
Huawei Mate 9 Android 8.0
