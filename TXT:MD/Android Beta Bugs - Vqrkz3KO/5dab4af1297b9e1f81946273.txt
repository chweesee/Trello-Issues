####Steps to reproduce:
- Open someone's profile that has 4 mutual servers (any number would count as long as it would still give an extra space on the list) 
- Visit their "Mutual Servers" 
- Try to scroll to the bottom that the blue shadow will appear

####Expected result:
The blue shadow should appear at the very bottom of the list
####Actual result:
The blue shadow appears at the bottom of the last server on the list
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 9.7.4
####System settings:
Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime, Android 6.0.1
