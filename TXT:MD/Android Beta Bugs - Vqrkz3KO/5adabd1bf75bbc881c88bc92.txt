### I can no longer reproduce as of Android Alpha 7.0.3 on ZTE Blade Vantage running Android 7.1.1. I now see the invite of the Spotify music, and it will tell me that I could listen to it onto the desktop app.

Because I was no longer able to reproduce this bug, I am moving this ticket to Claimed Fixed. - Ghoul on 2018-07-04T02:37:35.915Z
