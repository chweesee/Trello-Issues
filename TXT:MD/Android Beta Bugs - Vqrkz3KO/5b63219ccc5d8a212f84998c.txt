Reported by The Lunala#7777

####Steps to reproduce:
- Long press on any server where you have manage channels permission. 
- Open server settings. 
- Click on "Channels". 
- Click on the three lines and select any option. 
- Try to move the channel at the bottom, down and lift your finger.

####Expected result:
Nothing special happens.
####Actual result:
The whole screen loads like some changes were made and a toast appears saying "Channel order updated". Similar thing happens when you try the repro steps when sorting a server.
####Client settings:
Discord Alpha 721
####System settings:
Lenovo vibe K5+, 5.1.1
