### Can reproduce.
Game:apex legends - when the overlay is enabled for the game and you enter either training or an actual match a white dot shows up in the center of your screen and your mouse cursor becomes visible and moves around when you aim. there is another similar issue below this one that a r/discordapp mod said it should have been fixed but that was only partially fixed, the part where you couldn't move your aim in specific.

lag#0846 - Bug Bot on 2019-02-20T17:09:39.727Z


### Can reproduce.
<Game: Apex Legends, Windows 10 x64 Home. If the discord overlay is enabled you cannot aim with a mouse in Apex Legends . A system cursor is on top of the crosshair that moves when you try to aim with a mouse and then snaps back to the center. If you are using a controller you can aim but the cursor is still there.

Action Steps: 
- Enable the Discord overlay for Apex Legends (this can before or while playing)- Launch the game (using any display settings i.e. fullscreen or borderless) - Load into training mode (or a match but training is less chaotic) - In order to show the controller bug simply plug in a controller, and you should see a cursor in the center of the screen (but you will now be able to aim)

### On Discord Canary Build 24815, when I launch the game called PC Building Simulator with Discord's overlay on (apparently was a older version of the overlay as the build from last night was working fine). 

The game would launch, and then would stop responding as soon that I had selected to continue the game. I can see my Discord overlay, but the game is non-responsive. No matter what with the overlay on, the game would always stop responding and it is irritating.

- Change keyboard input to Polish (Programmer/Programisty)

- Start typing any message in the text box

- Observe the behaviour of the message

Windows 10 x64 1803 (17134.285), Canary 24461 
Can repro with Latvian (Standard) keyboard when pressing `AltGr-A`, or `AltGr-Z`. However, when pressing `'` (quote) followed by A or Z result is as expected. Additionally, AltGr-C copies selected text, but `­'` (quote) followed by C does not.
Suspecting conflict with AltGr being technically Ctrl+LeftAlt, thus firing select all, undo, copy Windows hotkeys before entering the character. Because a `ż` or `ž` character is entered after firing undo, redo is no longer available. On the other hand, after replacing all text with `ą` or `ā` it is possible to Ctrl-Z to bring back what the text was before replacing.
For Latvian users workaround can be to use Latvian (Standard) keyboard instead of or alongside Latvian (QWERTY) and type with `'` (quote) rather than AltGr, and for Polish keyboards (214) types `ą` and `ż` as expected, but is unfortunately a QWERTZ layout.

####Steps to reproduce:
- in a game (tested in osu, minecraft, rayman origins and TBOIA+) open the overlay 
- make sure that you are in a server you didn't create, you don't own and has over 12 roles 
- you need to have either admin perms or manage roles perms 
- make sure to not update nor change perms of any role while the game is open 
- click on a user that has only 1 or 2 roles 
- click ""+"" to add more roles 
- observe how many roles there are in the list and wich ones 
- close the game, go to the same server and repeat steps 5, 6 and 7 with the same member

####Expected result:
you should see the same roles in the list in both cases
####Actual result:
in overlay, some roles are missing, sometimes you can't removes some roles from the member (depends of which roles has someone) and sometimes roles that are above your higher role will appear

- After opening the game (full screen), try to open overlay.  
- Once the overlay opens, switch back to Discord 
- Switch back to the game and attempt to interact with overlay

####Steps to reproduce:
- Using Device Manager's ""Display Adapters"" tab please ensure you have the following hardware requirements: An integrated Intel Graphics Card and an nVidia GeForce Card on the same device (Any generation of both) *See attachments for examples* 
- Ensure your integrated Graphics Card is not disabled or ""uninstalled""  
- Enable the Discord Overlay either before running the game, or after the game starts (Found by lieuwe_berg#8662) 
- Start any version of non modified (Vanilla) Minecraft

####Expected result:
The game should complete it's startup and notify the user that the Discord Overlay is available with their selected keybinds.
####Actual result:
The game either completes startup and doesnt notify the user of the overlay (and the bug must be forced by interacting with a part of the title screen) or the game doesnt complete startup at all. This is due to Discords inability to determine what graphics card Minecraft is using (see attachments)

The popup should show telling you the keycombo you chose to open the overlay, and the keycombo actually opens the overlay like it does in all other games. (all I know, this may occur with other games, too)

####Steps to reproduce:
- Go into Game Activity in user settings and disable the overlay for a Rich Presence game “I used Fortnite” 
- Launch the Rich Presence game that you disabled the overlay on 
- After the game is started, tab back to Discord and refresh it using Ctrl + R 
- Right after you refresh, switch back to the game before Discord has loaded in 
- After switching back to the game, wait around 20-30 seconds, and watch for the overlay prompt to appear 
- When the overlay prompt appears, enter the keybind that appears on the prompt

####Expected result:
Overlay prompt should not appear, and allow you to open the overlay because it’s disabled for that game
####Actual result:
Overlay prompt appears, and allows you to show the overlay despite it being disabled for that game

- Then use the keybind that is already there to disable overlay 
- Observe

####Expected result:
The box shouldn't say it is recording a keybind
####Actual result:
The box still shows that it is recording a keybind when in reality it isn't

### While these are some reproduceable steps for this bug. This bug has effected me COUNTLESS times as I generally like to view bug-hunter-general-chat while in overlay. I have a short chat so I can see as much of game as I can which makes this bug FAR easier to reproduce. I've also noticed that Discord Message Links (and similar) Seem to be TERRIBLE at causing this bug to happen and sometimes even leaving you scroll up chat 2/3 lines in a single open/close of overlay

####Steps to reproduce:
- Enable the Discord overlay for a game (I tested this on TESV: Skyrim). 
- Load this game and toggle the overlay. 
- Either find a user who was banned/left server and had roles, or wait for someone to be banned/leave the server. 
- Find a mention for them in chat that parses. 
- Observe the card.

####Expected result:
Like in the main client, if the user is no longer part of the guild, it should update to show them as being not in the server.
####Actual result:
They are cached as being part of the server and having whatever roles they had before leaving/being banned, which can be confusing for users who're banned.
