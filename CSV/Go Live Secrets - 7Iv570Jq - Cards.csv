### unalignedant here.

I hesitate to call this a bug...

There is an argument for leaving it unpaused, as a popout is an intentional action and the streamer may want to preview their stream on another monitor. This is why it currently doesn't pause for anyone when in popout. - Kyle on 2019-04-27T21:04:12.038Z

**Steps to reproduce:** 
- Open Discord Canary/PTB/Stable
- Hover your mouse over someone who is streaming (should say live)
- Compare between the three clients (Canary/PTB/Stable)
- The images below should be ordered from Canary/PTB/Stable
**Expected Results:** Discord Canary is supposed to show the Previews because it's literally the only client that supports streaming at the moment.
**Actual Results:** Discord Stable is able to see the Previews of the stream without joining the VC whilst the other clients (Canary and PTB) cannot. Discord PTB just doesn't even load the Previews at all, therefore making it a blank modal.
**System Settings:** Windows 10 Pro 1809
**Client Settings:** In order: Discord Canary 36529, Discord PTB 36215, and Discord Stable 36345.","### Moved from Claimed Fixed, Needs Verification to Verified Fixed by webhp on 2019-06-14T01:15:47.055Z
