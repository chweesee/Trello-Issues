2017-04-16T14:50:05.430Z,2019-09-22T09:14:09.432Z,drag and drop doesn't work on KDE Plasma,"Reported by ao#4273

####Steps to reproduce: 
- Step 1: install kde plasma or some distro that uses it 
- Step 2: install discord 
- step 3: drag and drop a file or image from dolphin or any other file manager to discord 
- step 4: observe that it is not working 

####Expected result:

####Actual result:
 the image upload overlay goes away 
####System settings:
 KDE neon dev edition (based on ubuntu 16.04lte), kde plasma 5.9.4, kde frameworks version 5.33.0, qt version 5.7.1, kernel version 4.8.0-46-generic. Wasn't working on 17.04 beta with kubuntu either. I'm on canary.

Zleet#1558 - Bug Bot on 2019-01-12T08:42:36.904Z


### Note from a support ticket: 

""So the bug is caused by some file managers that by default are in `copy` 
mode when you drag and drop (as opposed to windows' default of being in 
`move` mode) and when discord tries to change `dropEffect` to something 
it's not allowed to it breaks. This can be reproduced on nautilus and 
dolphin because both behave this way. 
The fix is super simple, just change this line in 
`discord_app/components/UploadArea.js`: 

js 
e.dataTransfer.dropEffect = 'move'; 

to:

js 
e.dataTransfer.dropEffect = e.dataTransfer.effectAllowed == 'all' ? 
    'move' : e.dataTransfer.effectAllowed; "" - Clayton on 2018-09-05T21:04:46.682Z

### Verified.  - Clayton on 2017-05-26T22:54:39.294Z


### I don't think this is KDE specific; I'd say it's specific to how the file manager handles dragging files. Using Dolphin and a custom made file manager based on Qt didn't work, but I had no issues using Thunar on KDE. More specifically, Discord should accept a text/uri-list as a valid drop, and make sure that the URI scheme is ""file"" before loading that file up from disk.

ao#4273 - Bug Bot on 2017-04-19T04:11:16.559Z


### This isn't kde specific but it is dolphin specific. Holding shift while dropping allows it to be uploaded fine, but it doesn't open the caption dialog. Also, dropping with or without shift to a textbox on a browser etc does indeed give the file directory.

In the web client, it freezes. In the actual client, it crashes and auto-restarts. It's hard for me to experiment much further then this, beacuse i was video calling via my friend who was part of the 5%, and i was not, so i can only test durring active calls, debug log wont fit in discord message

### Instead of changing the input sensitivity of the recording for Discord direct, it changes the Input Device sensitivity. This also leads to the effect that the input device sensitivity always gets changed to the value set in Discord (So 100% by default) if the application gets reloaded/restarted.

####Steps to reproduce:
- Use Plasma desktop environment 
- Choose the default GTK3 theme (Breeze) as GTK theme in Settings -> Application Style 
- Start Firefox, look at any Discord server where scrollbars would appear (chat, userlist or channel list need to be long enough to scroll)

####Expected result:
The style should look roughly the same as with the Electron app (no white vertical lines next to scrollbars, no double scrollbars)
####Actual result:
With a light Breeze color setting and a dark Discord theme setting, light grey vertical lines appear next to all custom scrollbars in Discord. When the page is zoomed out, a second set of scrollbars becomes visible next to the Discord custom ones
####Client settings:
Current web version

### Unsetting the PATH directory so that Discord cannot start xdg-mime not only prevents this issue from happening, but does not effect game detection at all.  These calls seem like they can safely be completely removed as they do not seem to hurt the functionality of the app in any way when they cannot be made.

### Discord uses Electron for notification. For Linux, Electron uses `libnotify` for desktop notification. Unfortunately, `libnotify` blocks when cannot send notification: https://github.com/GNOME/libnotify/blob/master/libnotify/notification.c#L595-#L610. Unfortunately, not many updates to this project.

You can turn off Desktop Notification in Notification Settings or install a notification server (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Desktop_notifications). - Jozsef Vass on 2018-07-10T17:15:14.038Z

### Can reproduce.
CR, Discord Canary 0.0.45, build 11798, openSUSE Tumbleweed 20180307.  Discord freezes for about 30 seconds or so every time a notificatin is sent if the user does not have a notification daemon installed.  As there are multiple notification daemons that a user could have installed (and not just notify-osd), the real solution here is to make Discord aware that it failed to send a notification and not try to spam sending them which is what causes the client to freeze.  It's not really obvious that notifications are causing this to happen without the user doing a good deal of digging, so the option to turn off notifications is not sufficient for solving this issue.

####Steps to reproduce:
- Start Discord Canary and enter into a call (mostly tested with DMs) 
- No audio is heard by you or on other end of call (pavucontrol indicates it's not even connecting to Pulseaudio). 
- Go into Settings->Voice & Video and change Input and Output device to the same option or a different one and now the call works.

####Expected result:
Call records and plays back audio properly.
####Actual result:
Nothing heard or sent.

####Steps to reproduce:
- Open Discord 
- Go to User Settings 
- Move around your cursor while your clicking a few times on the left, you'll notice that you're able to drag the settings in a text-like fashion which is unexpected 
- Make sure to test around! It took me a little bit to get it working, but watch the video carefully if you cannot reproduce the first time, it's a certain spot that you have to do, I think

####Expected result:
Settings should not be able to be dragged easily like that
####Actual result:
Text can be easily dragged outside the client saving as a file, otherwise you can just move it around

MakiTheLegend#5027 - Bug Bot on 2018-07-31T08:36:34.792Z


### Can reproduce.
Can Reproduce - Discord refuses to snap into a corner, this is because the window would have to be resized smaller than the minimum resolution, however, discord should still snap just not to the size Linux wants. I'm not sure if this is just an issue with Ubuntu Mate 18.04 or something that can be fixed on Discords End. [Ubuntu Mate 18.04 - Canary 20174]

!systeminfo As the discord team might know, there's a bug on the linux client, which leads to a delayed audio when using DP or HDMI output.

As I found out, that does not happen, when an update is installed and it doesn't matter of throughout the app itself or with an app manager.
I don't know if you maybe already knew it, but I hope it helps you to localize the spring of this annoying bug.

Also, it doesn't happen in the web version of discord.

Or is already a fix in work?

Thanks in advance,
I hope I could help you! 😃

EDIT: I just found a temporary fix, I have to close the discord app and delete the 0.0.71 folder in ~/.config/discordcanary/ and when discord restarts it works without problems!
EDIT 2: It's actually enough to remove the installed.json in ~/.config/discordcanary/0.0.71/modules/
since then it also downloads 5 ""updates"" and then it's fixed.

So maybe you should have a look at what happens when an update is installed. 😃

As soon as I plug in the USB audio device (in my case, Dualshock 4 v2, as that controller has headphone jack and Discord reads it as an I/O audio device), the input from built-in disappears. Turns out GNOME setting overrides this setting, so if you change device in Discord, it will not affect, because GNOME setting set the controller audio jack as input device as soon as I plug in the controller. When I change it manually in GNOME setting, Discord reflects that as well (but the selected device in Discord setting is unchanged).

####Steps to reproduce:-Using Ubuntu 18.04 start Discord -Start a game (I specifically have this happen with Caves of Qud on Steam) -Click Gear to go to User Settings -Click Game Activity -In the green ""Now Playing"" box type a new name for the game you are currently playing (for Caves of Qud I changed it from 'CavesOfQud Configuration' to 'Caves of Qud') -Shut down the game you are playing -Completely close the Discord app (make sure it's not still running in background) -Reopen Discord and go back to Game Activity -Start the same game again -See that the name in the ""Now Playing"" box has changed back

####Expected result:
Discord should retain the custom input names of games after restarting the application.
####Actual result:
Discord loses the custom game display name data.
