- Go to Game Library in your settings, and find ""Install Location"". 
- Press Edit, and input any random name in ""Install Location Name"", then save it. 
- Then, go back to edit, and completely erase the name you inputted, and press save.

####Expected result:
Since there's nothing in the name, it should go back to ""Main"" by default, or it should say ""This field is required"".
####Actual result:
When you press save, it just goes back to the same name you had. It doesn't do anything.

####Steps to reproduce:
- Discord Store Page 

- Click on a game (Only seems to happen on Galactic Civilisations 3 as this is the only one using the YouTube player

I'd imagine that the YouTube video shouldn't autoplay when it's not in focus.
####Actual result:

####Steps to reproduce:
- Find a game in the store that you have in the library already. (Minion Masters is probably the best one to test with). 
- First, hover your mouse on the ""Add to Library"". You should see the ""Already in library"" popping up. Notice where that is popping up. 
- Then, hover your mouse on the ""Add to Library"", but this time, from bottom-up. Notice where it's popping up again.

####Expected result:
The pop-up should be consistent at the same spot.
####Actual result:
When you hover in any method outside of bottom-up, it will appear on top of the button. However, if you hover it from bottom-up, it will actually appear in the middle of the button.

- Go to the Billing tab 
- Click add a Payment Method 
- Once PayPal is shown, click ""Cancel and Return to Discord Inc.""

####Expected result:
The callback reflects that the payment was cancelled as well as the client. A new PayPal link should also be generated as it is no longer valid.
####Actual result:
Neither the client nor the callback reflect that the payment was canceled. Clicking the link and cancelling again will cause an error to occur (I assume this will also happen when continuing to add a PayPal account, but I don't have one at hand)

- try doing it the other way around (by scrolling up) and observe that it shows instantly which works as intended

####Steps to reproduce:

- Have someone play a Nitro game you haven't installed so it shows up on the Activity tab 
- Alternatively, you can copy and paste a store link to a Nitro game, but the highlight will be harder to spot 
- On the Activity tab, mouse over the Nitro game, and observe the top left corner of the install button 
- For pasting the store link, observe the top left corner of the install button right after you send the link 
- If you miss the highlight with pasting the link, switch channels and come back, observing the top left corner of the button right as you tab in

####Expected result:
Top left corner of install button doesn't highlight before the shine animation plays

Top left corner of install button highlights before the shine animation plays

####Steps to reproduce:
- Join a server with a STORE CHANNEL and Carousel 
- Make your Discord fill only 1 half of your screen [drag the tab to your left side of your desktop] 
- Click on the Video so it starts playing 
- Than Make your Discord cover the whole Screen again

####Expected result:
The Video that you've been watching should still be in the Middle of the page [Clicking on NEXT doesn't fix the glitch]
####Actual result:
The VIDEO or IMAGE or GIF is going to move to the side. As I said, you cannot fix it by clicking on the next media.
